<h2><a name="SECRET_NUMBER_ONE" id="SECRET_NUMBER_ONE"></a>SECRET NUMBER ONE</h2>
<h3>THE TRAGEDY OF THE LEUTENBERGS</h3>


<p>You will recollect our first meeting on that
sunny afternoon when, in the stuffy, nauseating
atmosphere of perspiration and a hundred
Parisian perfumes, we sat next each other at the
first roulette table on the right as you enter the
rooms at Monte Carlo?</p>

<p>Ah! how vivid it is still before my eyes, the
jingle of gold and the monotonous cries of the
croupiers.</p>

<p>Ah! my dear friend! In those pre-war days
the Riviera&mdash;that sea-lapped Paradise, with its
clear, open sky and sapphire Mediterranean, grey-green
olives and tall flowering aloes, its gorgeous
blossoms, and its merry, dark-eyed populace who
lived with no thought of the morrow&mdash;was, indeed,
the playground of Europe.</p>

<p>And, let me whisper it, I think I may venture to
declare that few of its annual habitu√©s enjoyed the
life more than your dear old ink-stained self.</p>

<p>What brought us together, you, an English
novelist, and I a&mdash;well, how shall I describe myself?
One of your enemies&mdash;eh? No, dear old fellow.
Let us sink all our international differences. May I
say that I, Count Ernst von Heltzendorff, of Schloss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
Heltzendorff, on the Mosel, late personal-adjutant
to His Imperial Highness the Crown-Prince, an
official attached to that precious young scoundrel's
immediate person, call you my dear friend?</p>

<p>True, our nations are, alas! at war&mdash;the war
which the Kaiser and his son long sought, but which,
as you well know, I have long ago detested.</p>

<p>I have repudiated that set of pirates and assassins
of whom I was, alas! born, and among whom I
moved until I learned of the vile plot afoot against
the peace of Europe and the chastity of its female
inhabitants.</p>

<p>On August 5th, 1914, I shook the dust of Berlin
from my feet, crossed the French frontier, and have
since resided in the comfortable old-fashioned
country house which you assisted me to purchase on
the border of the lovely forest of Fontainebleau.</p>

<p>And now, you have asked me to reveal to you
some of the secrets of Potsdam&mdash;secrets known to
me by reason of my official position before the war.</p>

<p>You are persuading me to disclose some facts concerning
the public and private life of the Emperor,
of my Imperial master the Crown-Prince, known
in his intimate circle as "Willie," and of the handsome
but long-suffering Cecil Duchess of Mecklenbourg,
who married him ten years ago and became
known as "Cilli." Phew! Poor woman! she has
experienced ten years of misery, domestic unhappiness,
by which she has become prematurely aged,
deep-eyed, her countenance at times when we talked
wearing an almost tragic look.</p>

<p>No wonder, indeed, that there is a heavy and,
alas! broken heart within the beautiful Marble
Palace at Potsdam, that splendid residence where
you once visited me and were afterwards commanded
to a reception held by His Imperial Highness.</p>

<p>I risk much, I know, in taking up my pen to tell
the truth and to make these exposures to you, but
I do so because I think it only just that your British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
nation should know the true character of the Emperor
and of the unscrupulous and ubiquitous
"Willie," the defiant young Blackguard of Europe,
who is the idol of the swaggering German Army,
and upon whom they pin their hopes.</p>

<p>It is true that the Commander of the Death's
Head Hussars&mdash;the "Commander" who has since
the war sanctioned the cold-blooded murder of
women and children, the shooting of prisoners,
rapine, incendiarism, and every other devil's work
that his horde of assassins could commit&mdash;once
declared that "the day will come when Social
Democrats will come to Court."</p>

<p>True, he has been known to be present at the
golden wedding festivities of a poor cobbler in
Potsdam; that he has picked up in his yellow
ninety-horse-power car&mdash;with its black imp as a
mascot&mdash;a poor tramp and taken him to the hospital;
and that he possesses the charming manner
of his much-worshipped grandfather, the Emperor
Frederick. But he is as clever and cunning as his
criminal father, Wilhehm-der-Pl√∂tzliche (William the
Sudden) or Der Einzige (The Only), as the Kaiser
is called by the people of the Palace. He shows
with double cunning but one side of his character
to the misguided German people, the Prussian Junker
party, and the Tom-Dick-and-Harry of the Empire
who have been made cannon-fodder and whose bones
lie rotting in Flanders and on the Aisne.</p>

<p>Ah, my dear friend, what a strange life was that
of the German Court before the war&mdash;a life of mummery,
of gay uniforms, tinsel, gilded decorations,
black hearts posing as virtuous, and loose people of
both sexes evilly scandalizing their neighbours and
pulling strings which caused their puppets to dance
to the War-Lord's tune.</p>

<p>I once lifted the veil slightly to you when you
stayed at the Palast Hotel in Potsdam and came to
us at the Marble Palace, and I suppose it is for that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
reason that you ask me to jot down, for the benefit
of your readers in Great Britain and her Dominions,
a few facts concerning the plots of the Kaiser and
his son&mdash;the idol of Germany, the Kronprinz
"Willie."</p>

<p>What did you think of him when I presented you?</p>

<p>I know how, later on that same night, you remarked
upon his height, his narrow chest, and his
corset-waist, and how strangely his animal eyes
set slant-wise in his thin, aquiline face, goggle eyes,
which dilate so strangely when speaking with you,
and which yet seem to penetrate your innermost
thoughts.</p>

<p>I agreed with you when you declared that there
was nothing outwardly of the typical Hohenzollern
in the Imperial Rake. True, one seeks in vain for
traces of martial virility. Though his face is so often
wreathed in boyish smiles, yet his heart is as hard
as that of the true Hohenzollern, while his pretended
love of sport is only a clever ruse in order to retain
the popularity which, by dint of artful pretence,
he has undoubtedly secured. Indeed, it was because
of the All-Highest One's jealousy of his reckless
yet crafty son's growing popularity that we were one
day all suddenly packed off to Danzig to be immured
for two long years in that most dreary and provincial
of all garrisons.</p>

<p>Of the peccadilloes of the elegant young blackguard
of Europe&mdash;who became a fully-fledged
colonel in the German Army at the age of thirty-one&mdash;I
need say but little. His life has been crammed
with disgraceful incidents, most of them hushed
up at the Kaiser's command, though several of
them&mdash;especially certain occurrences in the Engadine
in the winter of 1912&mdash;reached the ears of the
Crown-Princess, who, one memorable day, unable
to stand her husband's callous treatment, threatened
seriously to leave him.</p>

<p>Indeed, it was only by the Kaiser's autocratic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
order that "Cilli" remained at the Marmor Palace.
She had actually made every preparation to leave,
a fact which I, having learned it, was compelled to
report to the Crown-Prince. We were at the Palace
in the Zeughaus-Platz, in Berlin, at the time, and
an hour after I had returned from Potsdam I chanced
to enter the Crown-Prince's study. The door was
a self-locking one, and I had a key. On turning
my key I drew back, for His Majesty the Emperor,
a fine figure in the picturesque cavalry uniform of
the K√∂nigsj√§ger&mdash;who had just come from a review,
and had no doubt heard of the threatened Royal
scandal&mdash;was standing astride in the room.</p>

<p>"I compel it!" cried the Emperor, pale with
rage, his eyes flashing as he spoke. "She shall
remain! Go to her at once&mdash;make your peace with
her in any way you can&mdash;and appear to-night with
her at the theatre."</p>

<p>"But I fear it is impossible. I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Have you not heard me?" interrupted the
Emperor, disregarding his son's protests. And as
I discreetly withdrew I heard the Kaiser add:
"Cannot you, of our House of Hohenzollern, see
that we cannot afford to allow Cilli to leave us?
The present state of the public mind is not encouraging,
much as I regret it. Remember Frederick
August's position when that madcap Luisa of Tuscany
ran away with the French tutor Giron. Now
return to Marmor without delay and do as I bid."</p>

<p>"I know Cilli. She will not be appeased. Of
that I am convinced," declared the young man.</p>

<p>"It is my will&mdash;the will of the Emperor," were
the last words I heard, spoken in that hard, intense
voice I knew so well. "Tell your wife so. And
do not see that black-haired Englishwoman again.
I had a full report from the Engadine a fortnight
ago, and this <i>contretemps</i> is only what I have expected.
It is disgraceful! When will you learn
reason?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>Ten minutes later I was seated beside the Crown-Prince
in the car on our way to Potsdam.</p>

<p>On the road, driving recklessly as I sat by his
side, he laughed lightly as he turned to me, saying:</p>

<p>"What an infernal worry women really are&mdash;aren't
they, Heltzendorff&mdash;more especially if one is
an Imperial Prince! Even though one is a Hohenzollern
one cannot escape trouble!"</p>

<p>How the conjugal relations were resumed I know
not. All I know is that I attended their Imperial
Highnesses to the Lessing Theatre, where, in the
Royal box, the Kaiser&mdash;ever eager to stifle the shortcomings
of the Hohenzollerns&mdash;sat with us, though
according to his engagements he should have been
on his way to D√ºsseldorf for a great review on the
morrow. But such public display allayed all rumour
of his son's domestic infelicity, and both Emperor
and Kronprinz smiled benignly upon the people.</p>

<p>Early next day the Crown-Prince summoned
me, in confidence, and an hour later I left on a
secret mission to a certain lady whom I may call
Miss Lilian Greyford&mdash;as it is not fair in certain
cases in these exposures to mention actual names&mdash;daughter
of an English county gentleman, who was
staying at the "Kulm" at St. Moritz.</p>

<p>Twenty-four hours afterwards I managed to see
the winter-sports young lady alone in the hotel, and
gave her a verbal message, together with a little
package from His Imperial Highness, which, when
she opened it, I found contained a souvenir in the
shape of an artistic emerald pendant. With it were
some scribbled lines. The girl&mdash;she was not much
more than twenty&mdash;read them eagerly, and burst
into a torrent of tears.</p>

<p>Ah! my dear Le Queux, as you yourself know
from your own observations, there are as many
broken hearts beating beneath the corsets of ladies-in-waiting
and maids-of-honour, as there are among
that frantic feminine crowd striving to enter the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
magic circle of the Royal entourage or the women
of the workaday world who pass up Unter-den-Linden
on a Sunday.</p>

<p>Phew! What a world of fevered artificiality
revolves around a throne!</p>

<p>Very soon after this incident&mdash;namely, in the
early days of 1912&mdash;I found myself, as the personal-adjutant
of His Imperial Highness the Crown-Prince,
involved in a very strange, even inexplicable, affair.</p>

<p>How shall I explain it? Well, the drama opened
in the Emperor's Palace in Berlin on New Year's
night, 1912, when, as usual, a Grand Court reception
was held.</p>

<p>The scene was one which we who revolve around
the throne know so well. Court gowns, nodding
plumes, gay uniforms, and glittering decorations&mdash;a
vicious, tinselled, gossip-loving little world which
with devilish intent sows seeds of dark suspicion or
struggles for the Kaiser's favour.</p>

<p>In the famous White Salon, with its ceiling gaudily
emblazoned with the arms of the Hohenzollerns as
Burgraves, Electors, Kings, Emperors, and what-not,
its walls of coloured marble and gilded bronze,
and its fine statues of the Prussian rulers, we had
all assembled and were waiting the entrance of the
Emperor.</p>

<p>Kiderlen-Waechter&mdash;the Foreign Secretary&mdash;was
standing near me, chatting with Von Jagow, slim,
dark-haired and spruce. The latter, who was serving
as German Ambassador in Rome, happened to be
in Berlin on leave, and the pair were laughing
merrily with a handsome black-haired woman whom
I recognized as the Baroness Bertieri, wife of the
Italian Ambassador.</p>

<p>Philip Eulenburg, one of the Emperor's personal
friends (by the way, author, with Von Moltke, of
the Kaiser's much-advertised "Song to √Ügir"&mdash;a
fact not generally known), approached me and
began to chat, recalling a side-splitting incident that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
had occurred a few days before at Kiel, whither I had
been with the Crown-Prince to open a new bridge.
Oh, those infernal statues and bridges!</p>

<p>Of a sudden the tap of the Chamberlain's stick
was heard thrice, the gold-and-white doors instantly
fell open, and the Emperor, his decorations gleaming
beneath the myriad lights, smilingly entered with his
waddling consort, the Crown-Prince, and their
brilliant suite.</p>

<p>All of us bowed low in homage, but as we did so
I saw the shrewd eyes of the All-Highest One, which
nothing escapes, fixed upon a woman who stood close
to my elbow. As he fixed his fierce gaze upon her
I saw, knowing that glance as I did, that it spoke
volumes. Hitherto I had not noticed the lady, for
she was probably one of those unimportant persons
who are commanded to a Grand Court, wives and
daughters of military nobodies, of whom we at the
Palace never took the trouble to inquire so long as
their gilt command-cards, issued by the Grand
Chamberlain, were in proper order.</p>

<p>That slight contraction of the Emperor's eyebrows
caused me to ponder deeply, for, knowing him
so intimately, I saw that he was intensely annoyed.</p>

<p>For what reason? I was much mystified.</p>

<p>Naturally I turned to glance at the woman whose
presence had so irritated him. She was fair-haired,
blue-eyed, <i>petite</i> and pretty. Her age was about
twenty-five, and she was extremely good-looking.
Beside her stood a big, fair-haired giant in the
uniform of a captain of the First Regiment of the
Hussars of the Guard, of which the Crown-Prince
was Colonel-in-Chief.</p>

<p>Within a quarter of an hour I discovered that
the officer was Count Georg von Leutenberg, and
that his pretty wife, whom he had married two
years before, was the eldest daughter of an English
financier who had been created a Baron by your
rule-of-thumb politicians.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>"Pretty woman, eh?" lisped Eulenburg in my
ear, for he had noticed her, and he was assuredly
the best judge of a pretty face in all Berlin.</p>

<p>Next day, just before noon, on entering the
Crown-Prince's private cabinet, I found "Willie"
in the uniform of the 2nd Grenadiers, apparently
awaiting me in that cosy apartment, which is
crammed with effigies, statuettes, and relics of the
great Napoleon, whom he worships just as the War
Lord reveres his famous ancestor Frederick the Great.</p>

<p>"Sit down, Heltzendorff," said his Elegant Highness,
waving his white, well-manicured hand to a
chair near by, and puffing at his cigarette. "It is
really pleasant to have an hour's rest!" he laughed,
for he seemed in merry mood that day. "Look
here! As you know, after the little affair with the
Crown-Princess I trust to your absolute discretion.
Do you happen to know Count Georg von Leutenberg,
of the Hussars of the Guard?"</p>

<p>"By sight only," was my reply. Mention of that
name caused me to wonder.</p>

<p>"He is a very good fellow, I understand. Do you
know his wife&mdash;a pretty little Englishwoman?"</p>

<p>"Unfortunately, I have not that pleasure."</p>

<p>"Neither have I, Heltzendorff," laughed the
Prince, with a queer look in those slant-set eyes
which appear so strangely goggly sometimes. "But
I soon shall know her, I expect. In that direction
I want your assistance."</p>

<p>"I am yours for your Highness to command,"
I replied, puzzled to know what was in progress.
After a few seconds of silence the Crown-Prince
suddenly exclaimed:</p>

<p>"So good is the report of Von Leutenberg that
has reached the Emperor that&mdash;though he is as yet
in ignorance of the fact&mdash;he has been promoted to the
rank of major, and ordered upon a foreign mission&mdash;as
military attach√© in London. He will leave Berlin
to-night to take up his new post."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>"And the Countess?"</p>

<p>"By a secret report I happen to have here it is
shown that they are a most devoted pair," he said,
glancing at a sheet of buff paper upon which was
typed a report, one which I recognized as emanating
from the secret bureau at the Polizei-Prasidium, in
Alexander Platz. "They live in the Lennestrasse,
No. 44, facing the Tiergarten. Note the address."</p>

<p>Then his Highness paused, and, rising, crossed to
the big writing-table set in the window, and there
examined another report. Afterwards, glancing at
the pretty buhl clock opposite, he suddenly said:</p>

<p>"The Count should call here now. I have sent informing
him of the Emperor's goodwill, and ordering
him to report here to take leave of me as his Colonel-in-Chief."</p>

<p>Scarcely had he spoken when Count von Leutenberg
was announced by a flunkey in pink silk stockings,
and a moment later the tall officer clicked his
heels together and saluted smartly on the threshold.</p>

<p>"I thought you would be pleased at your well-merited
promotion," said his Highness in quite a
genial tone. "The Emperor wishes you to leave for
London by the ten o'clock express for Flushing
to-night, so as to report to his Excellency the Ambassador
before he departs on leave. Hence the
urgency. The Countess, of course, will remain in
Berlin. You will, naturally, wish for time to make
your arrangements in London and dispose of your
house here."</p>

<p>"I think she will wish to accompany me, your
Imperial Highness," replied the fond husband.
"London is her home."</p>

<p>"Ah! That is absurd!" laughed "Willie."
"Why, you who have been married two whole years
are surely not still upon your honeymoon?" and his
close-set eyes glinted strangely. "You will be far
too busy on taking up your new appointment to see
much of her. No. Let her remain comfortably at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
home in Berlin until you are quite settled. Then I
will see that Kiderlen grants you leave to return to
put your house in order."</p>

<p>From the Count's manner I could see that he was
very much puzzled at his sudden promotion.</p>

<p>Indeed, on entering he had stammered out his
surprise at being singled out for such high distinction.</p>

<p>Von Leutenberg's hesitation was the Crown-Prince's
opportunity.</p>

<p>"Good!" went on his Highness in his imperious,
impetuous way. "You will leave for London to-night,
and the Countess will remain until you have
settled. I congratulate you most heartily upon
your well-deserved advancement, which I consider
is an honour conferred by the Emperor upon my
regiment. I know, too, that you will act to the
honour of the Fatherland abroad."</p>

<p>And with those words the major was dismissed.</p>

<p>"A charming man!" remarked the Prince, after
the door had closed. "He has only been brought
to my notice quite recently. An enthusiastic officer,
he will be of great use to us at Carlton House Terrace.
There is much yet to be done there, my dear Heltzendorff.
Fortunately we have put our friends the
English comfortably to sleep. It has cost us money,
but money talks in London, just as it does in Berlin."</p>

<p>And he drew a long, ecstatic breath at the mere
thought of the great international plot in progress&mdash;of
the staggering blow to be struck against France,
and the march upon Paris with those men who were
his boon companions&mdash;Von Kluck, Von Hindenburg
and Von der Goltz.</p>

<p>"Heltzendorff," he exclaimed a few moments
later, after he had reflected deeply between the whiffs
of his cigarette. "Heltzendorff, I wish you to become
acquainted with the Countess von Leutenberg,
and you must afterwards introduce me. I have a
fixed and distinct reason. I could obtain the assistance
of others, but I trust you only."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>"But I do not know the lady," I protested, for
I had no desire whatsoever to become implicated in
any double-dealing.</p>

<p>"Hohenstein knows her well. I will see that he
introduces you," replied the Kaiser's son, with that
strange look again in his eyes. "She's uncommonly
pretty, so mind you don't fall in love with her!" he
laughed, holding up his finger reprovingly. "I've
heard, too, that Count Georg is a highly jealous person,
but, fortunately, he will be very busy writing
secret reports at Carlton House Terrace. So go and
see Hohenstein at once, and get him to introduce
you to the pretty little Englishwoman. But, remember,
not a word of this conversation is to be
breathed to a single soul."</p>

<p>What did it all mean? Why had the Emperor
singled out for advancement the husband of that
woman, the sight of whom had so greatly annoyed
him? I confess that I became more than ever
puzzled over the curious affair.</p>

<p>Within a week, however, thanks to the introduction
of that old rou√©, Hohenstein, I had dined at
Count von Leutenberg's pretty house in the Lennestrasse
in a fine room, the long windows of which
commanded a delightful view over the Tiergarten
and the Siegesallee.</p>

<p>The Countess, extremely charming and refined,
having the misfortune of being English, had not been
taken up warmly by Berlin society. She was, I
found, a most delightful hostess. The party included
Laroque, the elegant First Secretary of the French
Embassy, and his Parisian wife, together with Baron
Hoffmann, the burly, round-faced Minister of the
Interior, and Doctor Paulssen, Under-Secretary at
the Colonial Office, against whom you will remember
there were allegations of atrocities committed upon
the natives in German East Africa. Hohenstein
was, however, not there, as he had been suddenly
dispatched by the Emperor upon a mission to Corfu.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>At table the talk ran upon Leutenberg's sudden promotion,
whereupon the Minister Hoffmann declared:</p>

<p>"His Majesty only gives reward when it is due.
When he discerns talent he is never mistaken."</p>

<p>A week later the Crown-Prince had returned from
a surprise visit the Kaiser had made to Stettin.
The Emperor had played his old game of rousing the
garrison in the middle of the night, and then
laughing at the ludicrous figures cut by his pompous
Generals and Colonels rushing about in their night
attire eager to greet their Sovereign.</p>

<p>I was in the Prince's private room arranging the
details of a military programme at Potsdam on the
following day when he suddenly entered and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Well, Heltzendorff, and how are you proceeding
in the Lennestrasse, eh?" and he looked at me with
those crafty eyes of his. "I hear you were at the
house last night."</p>

<p>I started. Was I being watched? It was quite
true that I had called on the previous evening, and,
finding the Countess alone, had sat in her pretty
drawing-room enjoying a long and delightful chat
with her.</p>

<p>"Yes. I called there," I admitted. "The Count
is returning from London next week to take his wife
back with him."</p>

<p>The Crown-Prince smiled mysteriously, and
critically examined the curious snake ring which he
always wears upon the little finger of his left hand.</p>

<p>"We need not anticipate that, I think. Kiderlen
will not grant him leave. He is far better in Carlton
House Terrace than in the Lennestrasse."</p>

<p>"I hardly follow your Highness," I remarked,
much mystified at his words.</p>

<p>"H'm. Probably not, my dear Count," he
laughed. "I do not intend that you should."</p>

<p>And with that mysterious remark he turned to
meet Count von Zeppelin, the round-faced, snow-haired,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
somewhat florid inventor, who was one of
his Highness's most intimate friends, and who had
at that moment entered unannounced. Zeppelin
was a character in Berlin. He sought no friends, no
advertisement, and shunned notoriety.</p>

<p>"Ha, my dear Ferdinand!" cried the Prince,
shaking the hand of the man who so suddenly became
world-famous at the age of seventy. "You have
travelled from Stuttgart to see me&mdash;unwell as you
are! It is an honour. But the matter is one of
greatest urgency, as I have already written to you.
I want to show you the correspondence and seek
your advice," and the Prince invited his white-haired
friend to the big, carved arm-chair beside his
writing-table. Then, turning to me, he said: "Will
you see Von Glasenapp for me, and hand him those
orders for Posen? He must leave to-night. The
General Court-Martial at Stendal I have fixed for
the 25th. I shall be with the Emperor this afternoon.
Report here at seven to-night&mdash;understand?"</p>

<p>Thus was I dismissed, while His Imperial Highness
and Count Zeppelin sat together in secret counsel.</p>

<p>At ten minutes to seven that evening I unlocked
the Crown-Prince's room with the key I carried, the
other two keys being in the hands of the Crown-Princess
and her husband. I had placed upon the
table a bundle of reports which had just been brought
round from the Ministry of War, and required that
scribbly signature, "Wilhelm Kronprinz," when I
noticed three private letters that had evidently been
placed aside. The envelopes were addressed in a
thin, angular, female hand, and bore an English
address. I noted it. The name on each was that
of a lady residing in Aylesbury Avenue, Hampstead,
London. The letters bore German stamps. In keen
curiosity, I took one and examined it, wondering
whether it could be the correspondence which the
Crown-Prince had been so eager to show Count
von Zeppelin in secret.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>I drew the letter from the envelope and scanned
it rapidly.</p>

<p>What I read caused me to hold my breath. The
signature to the letters was "Enid von Leutenberg."</p>

<p>Those letters of hers had, it was plain, been seized
in the post on their way to London. The Countess
either had a traitor in her household or secret watch
was being kept by the Secret Service upon her
correspondence.</p>

<p>All three of those letters I read&mdash;letters which
opened my eyes and broadened my mind. Then,
taking up my bundle of reports, I crept away from
the room, carefully re-latching the door. I intended
that his Highness should return, discover the
letters left there inadvertently, and put them away
ere my arrival, in which case he would never suspect
that I had any knowledge of their contents.</p>

<p>With the papers in my hand I passed along the
many carpeted corridors to the south wing of the
Palace, where I found Tresternitz, Marshal of the
Prince's Court, in his room.</p>

<p>The Crown-Prince imitated his father's sharp punctuality,
therefore I knew that he would be there at
seven or soon afterwards.</p>

<p>Tresternitz was always full of scandal concerning
those who lived in the higher circles of Berlin, and
it was to one of these stories of Court scandal concerning
one of the ladies-in-waiting which I listened
while I smoked one of his excellent Russian cigarettes.</p>

<p>Then, glancing at the clock, I rose suddenly and
left him, returning again to the private room.</p>

<p>I found his Highness there, and as I entered I
noticed that he had hidden those remarkable letters
which he had in secret shown to Count Zeppelin.</p>

<p>A fortnight went past. The Kaiser, with his mad
love of constant travel, had been rushing up and
down the Empire&mdash;to Krupp's at Essen, to the trials
of a newly-invented howitzer, thence to an inspection
at Kassel, and afterwards to unveil monuments at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
Cologne and at Erfurt. The Crown-Prince and
Princess had accompanied him, the Kaiserin being
indisposed, and I, of course, had been included in
"Willie's" suite.</p>

<p>The week had been a strenuous one of train-travel,
luncheons, tiring dinners, receptions, dancing,
and general junketings, and I was glad enough to
get back to my bachelor rooms&mdash;those rooms in the
Krausenstrasse that you knew so well before the
bursting of the war-cloud. To dance attendance
upon an Imperial Crown-Prince, as well as upon an
autocratic Emperor, becomes after a time a wearisome
business, however gay and cosmopolitan a
man may be.</p>

<p>I had only been at home a few hours when a
telephone message summoned me at five o'clock to
the Crown-Prince's Palace.</p>

<p>His Imperial Highness, who had, I knew, been
lunching with the Emperor at the K√∂nigliches
Schloss across the bridge, seemed unusually serious
and thoughtful. Perhaps the Emperor had again
shown his anger at his peccadilloes, as he did so
frequently.</p>

<p>"Count," he said, after a few seconds of silence,
during which I noted that upon his table lay a
private letter from the German Ambassador in
London. "You will recall my conversation regarding
the Countess von Leutenberg&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly," was my reply.</p>

<p>"I told you that I should require you to introduce
me," he said. "Well, I want you to do so this
evening. She has taken a box at the K√∂nigliche
Opera to-night, where they are to play <i>Falstaff</i>. I
shall be there, and you will be with me. Then you
will introduce me to your pretty friend. Understand?"
And he grinned.</p>

<p>That night, in accordance with my instructions,
I sat in the Emperor's box with the Crown-Prince,
Tresternitz, and two personal-adjutants, and, recognizing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
the Countess von Leutenberg in a box opposite,
accompanied by an elderly lady, I took the
Crown-Prince round, and there presented her to him,
greatly to her surprise and undisguised delight.</p>

<p>The Prince and the Countess chatted together,
while I sat with her elderly companion. Then, when
we had withdrawn, my Imperial Master exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Ah! my dear Heltzendorff. Why, she is one
of the prettiest women in all Berlin! Surely it is
unfortunate&mdash;most unfortunate."</p>

<p>What was unfortunate? I was further puzzled
by that last sentence, yet I dare not ask any explanation,
and we went back to our own box.</p>

<p>After our return to the Palace the Crown-Prince,
who was standing in one of the corridors talking
with the slim, fair-haired Baroness von Wedel, one
of his wife's ladies-in-waiting, left her and beckoned
me into an adjoining room.</p>

<p>"I wish you, Heltzendorff, to call upon the Countess
von Leutenberg at nine o'clock to-morrow evening.
She will expect you."</p>

<p>I looked at his Highness, much puzzled. How
did he know that the pretty Countess would expect
me?</p>

<p>But he gave me no time to reply, merely turning
upon his heel, and striding down the corridor to the
private apartments.</p>

<p>Punctually at nine o'clock that wintry evening
I called at the Lennestrasse, but Josef, the elderly
manservant, informed me that his mistress was
engaged, adding that His Imperial Highness the
Crown-Prince had paid a surprise call.</p>

<p>"The Crown-Prince here!" I gasped, astounded.</p>

<p>"Yes, Count. And, further, my mistress is in
high glee, for my master returned this morning quite
unexpectedly from London. He has been out at the
Ministry for Foreign Affairs all the evening, and
I expect him home at any moment. The Crown-Prince
ordered me to ask you to await him here."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>Count von Leutenberg in Berlin! What did it
mean? He was absurdly jealous, I recollected.
He might return at any moment and find the Crown-Prince
alone in the Countess's drawing-room. If
so, the situation might certainly be a most unpleasant
one.</p>

<p>Hardly had the thought crossed my mind when
I heard the Count enter, his spurs clinking and his
sabre rattling as he strode up the stairs.</p>

<p>I crept forth, listening breathlessly.</p>

<p>A few seconds later I heard the Count's voice
raised in anger and high, bitter words. Next moment
I sprang up the stairs and, dashing into the room,
found the pretty Countess standing near the window,
white and rigid as a statue, while the two men in
uniform faced each other. Von Leutenberg's countenance
was distorted with rage as he abused the
Crown-Prince, and openly charged him with having
brought about his exile to London.</p>

<p>His Highness made no reply, but only smiled
sarcastically and shrugged his narrow shoulders.</p>

<p>So enraged the other became at this latter gesture
that, with a sudden movement, he drew his sword.</p>

<p>The Countess shrieked and swooned as I sprang
forward and stayed her husband's hand.</p>

<p>It was a dramatic moment. The Count instantly
realized the enormity of his crime, and his hand
dropped.</p>

<p>"Enough!" cried the Crown-Prince, waving his
adversary aside. Then, turning to me, he said in
a calm, hard voice:</p>

<p>"Heltzendorff, you are witness that this man has
drawn his sword upon the heir to the Throne."</p>

<p>And with those haughty words he bowed stiffly
and strode out of the room.</p>

<p>Two hours later I was commanded to the Kaiser's
presence, and found him in counsel with his son.</p>

<p>The Emperor, who wore the uniform of the Guards,
looked pale and troubled, yet in his eyes there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
a keen, determined look. As I passed the sentries
and entered the lofty study, with its upholstery and
walls of pale green damask&mdash;that room from which
the Empire and the whole world have so often been
addressed&mdash;the Kaiser broke off short in his conversation.</p>

<p>Turning to me as he still sat at his littered table,
he said in that quick, impetuous way of his:</p>

<p>"Count Heltzendorff, the Crown-Prince has informed
me of what has occurred this evening in the
Lennestrasse. I wish you to convey this at once
to Count von Leutenberg and to give it into his own
hand. There is no reply."</p>

<p>And His Majesty handed me a rather bulky
envelope addressed in his own bold handwriting,
and bearing his own private cipher impressed in
black wax.</p>

<p>Thus commanded, I bowed, withdrew, and took
a taxicab straight to the Lennestrasse, being
ushered by Josef into the presence of husband and
wife in that same room I had quitted a couple of
hours before.</p>

<p>I handed the Count the packet the Emperor had
given me, and with trembling fingers he tore it open.</p>

<p>From within he drew three letters, those same
letters which his wife had written to London, and
which had been intercepted by the Secret Service&mdash;the
letters which I had read in his Highness's room.</p>

<p>As he scanned the lines which the Emperor had
penned his face blanched. A loud cry of dismay
escaped his wife as she recognized her own letters,
and she snatched the note from her husband's hand
and also read it.</p>

<p>The light died instantly from her beautiful countenance.
Then, turning to me, she said in a hoarse,
hopeless tone:</p>

<p>"Thank you, Count von Heltzendorff. Tell His
Majesty the Emperor that his command shall be&mdash;yes,
it shall be obeyed."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>Those last words she spoke in a deep, hoarse whisper,
a strange, wild look of desperation in her blue eyes.</p>

<p>An hour later I reported again at the Imperial
Palace, was granted audience of the Emperor, and
gave him the verbal reply.</p>

<p>His Majesty uttered no word, merely nodding his
head slowly in approval.</p>

<p>Next afternoon a painful sensation was caused
throughout Berlin when the <i>Abendpost</i> published the
news that Count von Leutenberg, the man so recently
promoted by the Emperor, and his pretty wife had
both been found dead in their room. During the
night they had evidently burned some papers, for
the tinder was found in the stove, and having agreed
to die together, they being so much attached during
life, they had both taken prussic acid in some wine,
the bottle and half-emptied glasses being still upon
the table.</p>

<p>The romantic affair, the truth of which I here
reveal for the first time, was regarded by all Berlin
as an inexplicable tragedy. The public are still
unaware of how those intercepted letters contained
serious warnings to the British Government of the
Emperor's hostile intentions towards Britain, and
the probable date of the outbreak of war. Indeed,
they recounted a private conversation which the
Countess had overheard between the Kaiser and
Count Zeppelin, repeating certain opprobrious
epithets which the All-Highest had bestowed upon
one or two British statesmen, and she also pointed
out the great danger of a pending rupture between the
two Powers, as well as explaining some details regarding
the improved Zeppelins in course of construction
secretly on Lake Constance, and certain scandals regarding
the private life of the Crown-Prince.</p>

<p>It was for the latter reason that the heir, aided
by the War-Lord, took his revenge in a manner so
crafty, so subtle, and so typical of the innate cunning
of the Hohenzollerns.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus the well-meant warnings of one of your good,
honest Englishwomen never reached the unsuspicious
address to which they were sent, and thus did
"Willie"&mdash;who, as I afterwards discovered, devised
that subtle vengeance&mdash;act as the Emperor's
catspaw.</p>

<h2><a name="SECRET_NUMBER_TWO" id="SECRET_NUMBER_TWO"></a>SECRET NUMBER TWO</h2>
<h3>THE CROWN-PRINCE'S REVENGE</h3>


<p>The Trautmann affair was one which caused
a wild sensation at Potsdam in the autumn
of 1912.</p>

<p>In the Emperor's immediate entourage there was
a great deal of gossip, most of it ill-natured and
cruel, for most ladies-in-waiting possess serpents'
tongues. Their tongues are as sharp as their
features, and though there may be a few pretty
maids-of-honour, yet the majority of women at
Court are, as you know, my dear Le Queux, mostly
plain and uninteresting.</p>

<p>I became implicated in the unsavoury Trautmann
affair, in a somewhat curious manner.</p>

<p>A few months after the Leutenberg tragedy I
chanced to be lunching at the "Esplanade" in
Berlin, chatting with Laroque, of the French Embassy.
Our hostess was Frau Breitenbach, a wealthy
Jewess&mdash;a woman who came from Dortmund&mdash;and
who was spending money like water in order to
wriggle into Berlin society. As personal-adjutant
of the Crown-Prince I was, of course, one of the
principal guests, and I suspected that she was angling
for a card of invitation to the next ball at the Marmor
Palace.</p>

<p>Who introduced me to the portly, black-haired,
rather handsome woman I quite forget. Probably it
was some nobody who received a commission upon
the introduction&mdash;for at the Berlin Court introductions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
are bought and sold just as the succulent
sausage is sold over the counter.</p>

<p>In the big white-and-gold <i>salle-√†-manger</i> of the
"Esplanade," which, as you know, is one of the
finest in Europe, Frau Breitenbach was lunching
with sixteen guests at one big round table, her
daughter Elise, a very smartly dressed girl of nineteen,
seated opposite to her. It was a merry party,
including as it did some of the most renowned persons
in the Empire, among them being the Imperial
Chancellor, Bethmann-Hollweg, of the long, grave
face and pointed beard, and that grand seigneur
who was a favourite at Court, the multi-millionaire
Serene Highness Prince Maximilian Egon zu F√ºrstenberg.
Of the latter it may be said that no man
rivalled his influence with the Emperor. What he
said was law in Germany.</p>

<p>F√ºrstenberg was head of the famous "Prince's
Trust," now dissolved, but at that time, with its
capital of a hundred million pounds, it was a great
force in the German commercial world. Indeed,
such a boon companion was he of the Kaiser's that
an august but purely decorative and ceremonial
place was actually invented for him as Colonel-Marshal
of the Prussian Court, an excuse to wear
a gay uniform and gorgeous decorations as befitted
a man who, possessing twenty millions sterling, was
an important asset to the Emperor in his deep-laid
scheme for world-power.</p>

<p>Another Prince of the "Trust" was fat old Kraft
zu Hohenlohe Oehringen, but as he had only a
paltry ten millions he did not rank so high in the
War-Lord's favour.</p>

<p>F√ºrstenberg, seated next to the estimable Jewess,
was chatting affably with her. Her husband was
in America upon some big steel transaction, but her
pretty daughter Elise sat laughing merrily with a
young, square-headed lieutenant of the Death's
Head Hussars.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>That merry luncheon party was the prologue of
a very curious drama.</p>

<p>I was discussing the occult with a middle-aged
lady on my right, a sister of Herr Alfred Ballin, the
shipping king. In society discussions upon the
occult are always illuminating, and as we chatted
I noticed that far across the crowded room, at a
table set in a window, there sat alone a dark-haired,
sallow, good-looking young civilian, who, immaculate
in a grey suit, was eating his lunch in a rather bored
manner, yet his eyes were fixed straight upon the
handsome, dark-haired young girl, Elise Breitenbach,
as though she exercised over him some strange
fascination.</p>

<p>Half a dozen times I glanced across, and on each
occasion saw that the young man had no eyes for
the notables around the table, his gaze being fixed
upon the daughter of the great financier, whose
interests, especially in America, were so widespread
and profitable.</p>

<p>Somehow&mdash;why I cannot even now decide&mdash;I felt
a distinct belief that the young civilian's face was
familiar to me. It was not the first time I had seen
him, yet I could not recall the circumstances in
which we had met. I examined my memory, but
could not recollect where I had before seen him, yet
I felt convinced that it was in circumstances of a
somewhat mysterious kind.</p>

<p>Two nights later I had dined with the Breitenbachs
at their fine house in the Alsenstrasse. The
only guest beside myself was the thin-faced, loud-speaking
old Countess von Bassewitz, and after
dinner, served in a gorgeous dining-room which
everywhere betrayed the florid taste of the parvenu,
Frau Breitenbach took the Countess aside to talk,
while I wandered with her daughter into the winter
garden, with its high palms and gorgeous exotics,
that overlooked the gardens of the Austrian Embassy.</p>

<p>When we were seated in cane chairs, and the man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
had brought us coffee, the pretty Elise commenced
to question me about life at the Crown-Prince's
Court, expressing much curiosity concerning the
private life of His Imperial Highness.</p>

<p>Such questions came often from the lips of young
girls in society, and I knew how to answer them with
both humour and politeness.</p>

<p>"How intensely interesting it must be to be
personal-adjutant to the Crown-Prince! Mother
is dying to get a command to one of the receptions
at Potsdam," the girl said. "Only to-day she was
wondering&mdash;well, whether you could possibly use
your influence in that direction?"</p>

<p>In an instant I saw why I had been invited to
dinners and luncheons so often, and why I had been
left alone with the sweet-faced, dark-eyed girl.</p>

<p>I reflected a moment. Then I said:</p>

<p>"I do not think that will be very difficult. I will
see what can be done. But I hope that if I am successful
you will accompany your mother," I added
courteously, as I lit a cigarette.</p>

<p>"It is really most kind of you," the girl declared,
springing up with delight, for the mere thought of
going to Court seemed to give her intense pleasure.
Yet all women, young and old, are alike in that
respect. The struggle to set foot near the throne
is, as you yourself have seen, always an unseemly
one, and, alas! the cause of many heart-burnings.</p>

<p>When I looked in at Tresternitz's room in the
Palace next morning, I scribbled down the name of
mother and daughter for cards.</p>

<p>"Who are they?" grunted the old marshal,
removing a big cigar from his puffy lips.</p>

<p>"People I know&mdash;they're all right, and the girl
is very good-looking."</p>

<p>"Good. We can do with a little beauty here
nowadays. We've had an infernally ugly lot at
the balls lately," declared the man, who was the
greatest gossip at Court, and who thereupon commenced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
to tell me a scandalous story regarding one
of the ladies-in-waiting to the Kaiserin who had
disappeared from the New Palace, and was believed
to be living in Scotland.</p>

<p>"The Emperor is furious," he added. "But he
doesn't know the real truth, and never will, I
expect."</p>

<p>A week later the Crown-Prince and Princess gave
a grand ball at the Marmor Palace at Potsdam, and
the Emperor himself attended.</p>

<p>Frau Breitenbach, gorgeously attired, made her
bow before the All-Highest, and her daughter did
the same.</p>

<p>That night I saw that the Kaiser was in no good
mood. He seldom was at the Court functions.
Indeed, half an hour before his arrival the Crown-Prince
had told me, in confidence, of his father's
annoyance at the failure of some diplomatic negotiations
with Britain.</p>

<p>The Emperor, in his brilliant uniform, with the
Order of the Black Eagle, of which he was <i>chef-souverain</i>,
and the diamond stars of many foreign
Orders, presented a truly Imperial figure, his shrewd,
unrelenting gaze everywhere, his upturned moustache
accentuated, his voice unusually sharp and commanding.</p>

<p>I spoke with Elise, and afterwards, when I danced
with her I saw how impressed she was by the glitter
and glamour of the Potsdam Court circle, and by
the fact that she was in the presence of the All-Highest
One, without whose gracious nod nothing
could hope to prosper in the Fatherland, and
without whose approval no public work could be
undertaken in Berlin. Those statesmen, admirals
and generals present might plan, but he alone willed.
His approval or his frown was as a decree of Providence,
and his autocratic will greater than that of
his "brother," Nicholas of Russia.</p>

<p>I remember how, one day in the Milit√§r-Kabinett,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
an old buffer at Court whom we called "Hans"
Hohenlohe&mdash;he was one of the hundred and sixty
odd members of the aristocratic family of Hohenlohe
which swarm the Fatherland, mostly penurious, by-the-way,
salary-grabbers, all elbowing each other
to secure the Kaiser's favour&mdash;made a very true
remark which has ever remained in my memory.
It was very soon after Herr von Libenau, the Imperial
Master of Ceremony, had been arrested owing
to a scandal at Court, though perfectly innocent.
My friend "Hans" Hohenlohe said in a low, confidential
whisper at a shooting party, after the
French Ambassador had wished us a merry <i>bon jour</i>
and passed out:</p>

<p>"My dear friend Heltzendorff, you, like myself,
know that war is inevitable. It must come soon!
The reason is to be found in the madness of the
Emperor, which has spread among our military
party and among the people, till most of them are
no more sane than himself. Hypnotized by good
fortune, we have become demented with an overweening
vanity and a philosophy which must end
in our undoing. The Emperor's incessant drum-beating,
sabre-rattling, and blasphemous appeals
to the Almighty have brought our German nation
to that state which, since the world began, has
ever gone before destruction."</p>

<p>No truer words were ever spoken of modern
Germany.</p>

<p>They recurred to me as, while waltzing with the
pretty daughter of the Dortmund parvenu, I
noticed the Emperor standing aside, chatting with
old Von Zeppelin, who every now and then patted
his silvery hair, a habit of his when in conversation.
With the pair stood Ernst Auguste, the young
Duke of Brunswick, who in the following year married
the Emperor's daughter, the rather petulant and
go-ahead Victoria Louise. The Prince, who wore
the uniform of the Prussian Guard, was laughing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
heartily over some remark of old Zeppelin's as,
with my partner, I passed quite close to them.</p>

<p>The dainty Elise was, I found, quite an entertaining
little person. Old Tresternitz had already whispered
his opinion of her.</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly the prettiest girl at Court," he
had declared, with a twinkle in his grey eyes.</p>

<p>From words the pretty Elise let drop that night
as she hung upon my arm I wondered whether she
was really as ingenuous as she pretended. And yet
Frau Breitenbach was one of dozens of others
who strove to enter the Court circle, flapping their
wings vainly to try and cross the wide gulf which
separated the "high life" in Berlin from "Court
life."</p>

<p>The rooms were stifling, therefore I took my pretty
dancing partner along a corridor and through several
deserted apartments into the east wing of the Palace,
showing her some of the Crown-Princess's private
rooms, until at length we stepped through a French
window on to the long terrace before the lake, the
Heilige-See.</p>

<p>There we were alone. The white moon was
reflected upon the waters, and after the heat of the
ball-room the balmy air was delightful.</p>

<p>Against the marble balustrade beside the water
I stood chatting with her. All was silent save for
the tramp of soldiers passing near, for the guard
was at that hour changing. As became a courtier,
I chaffed and laughed with her, my intention being
to learn more concerning her.</p>

<p>But she was, I found, an extremely discreet
and clever little person, a fact which further increased
the mystery.</p>

<p>One night about two months later I had an appointment
with Max Reinhardt at the Deutsches
Theater, in Berlin, to arrange a Royal visit there,
and after the performance I went back to the Palace,
prior to retiring to my rooms in the Krausenstrasse.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
The guards saluted as I crossed the dark courtyard,
and having passed through the corridors to the
private apartments I entered with my key the
Crown-Prince's locked study.</p>

<p>To my surprise, I found "Willie" seated there
with the Emperor in earnest discussion.</p>

<p>With apology, I bowed instantly and withdrew,
whereupon the Kaiser exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Come in, Heltzendorff. I want you."</p>

<p>Then he cast a quick, mysterious glance at the
young man, who had thrown himself in lazy attitude
into a long cane lounge chair. It was as though
His Majesty was hesitating to speak with me, or
asking his son's permission to do so.</p>

<p>"Tell me, Heltzendorff," exclaimed His Majesty
suddenly, "do you know this person?" and he
placed before my astonished gaze a very artistic
cabinet photograph of the pretty Elise.</p>

<p>"Yes," I answered frankly, quite taken aback.
"It is Fr√§ulein Breitenbach."</p>

<p>"And what do you know of her?" inquired His
Majesty sharply. "You introduced her and her
mother to Court, I believe."</p>

<p>I saw that the Emperor had discovered something
which annoyed him. What could it be?</p>

<p>At once I was compelled to admit that I had set
down their names for invitation, and, further, I
explained all that I knew about them.</p>

<p>"You are certain you know nothing more?"
asked the Emperor, his brows contracted and his
eyes fixed steadily upon mine. "Understand that
no blame attaches to you."</p>

<p>I assured him that I had revealed all that I knew
concerning them.</p>

<p>"Hold no further communication with either
mother or daughter," His Majesty said. "Leave for
Paris by the eight o'clock train to-morrow morning,
and go to Baron von Steinmetz, the chief of our
confidential service in France."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, turning to the Crown-Prince, he said: "You
have his address."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the younger man. "He is passing as
Monsieur Felix Reumont, and is living at 114 bis,
Avenue de Neuilly, close to the Pont."</p>

<p>I scribbled the name and address upon the back
of an envelope, whereupon His Majesty said:</p>

<p>"Carry my verbal orders to Steinmetz, and tell
him to act upon the orders I sent him by courier
yesterday. And you will assist him. He will explain
matters fully when you arrive."</p>

<p>Then, crossing to the Crown-Prince's writing-table,
His Majesty took a large envelope, into
which, with the same hand, he dexterously placed
the photograph with several papers, and sealed
them with the Crown-Prince's seal. At the
moment the Crown-Princess entered, said some
words to her husband in a low voice, and went
out again.</p>

<p>"Give this to Von Steinmetz from me," His Majesty
said after she had gone.</p>

<p>I bowed as I took it from His Majesty's hand, my
curiosity now greatly excited regarding Frau Breitenbach
and her pretty daughter. What, I wondered,
was in the wind?</p>

<p>"And, Heltzendorff, please report to me," remarked
the Heir, still lounging lazily in the chair, his white,
well-manicured hands clasped behind his head.
"Where shall you stay?"</p>

<p>"At the H√¥tel Chatham. I always stay there in
preference to the larger hotels."</p>

<p>"And not a bad judge," laughed His Majesty
merrily. "I remember when I used to go to Paris
incognito one could dine at the 'Chatham' most
excellently&mdash;old-fashioned, but very good. Vian's,
across the road, is also good."</p>

<p>The Kaiser knows Paris well, though he has never
visited the French capital openly.</p>

<p>Bowing, I took leave of my Imperial master, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
next morning at eight o'clock, set out upon my
mysterious mission.</p>

<p>I found the Baron von Steinmetz living in a good-sized
house in the leafy Avenue de Neuilly, not far
from the bridge. One of the cleverest and most
astute officials that Germany possessed, and a man
high in the Kaiser's favour, he had, in the name of
Felix Reumont, purchased, with Government funds
of course, a cinema theatre in the Rue Lafayette, and
ostensibly upon the proceeds of that establishment
lived comfortably out at Neuilly.</p>

<p>At eleven o'clock in the morning his valet, evidently
a German, showed me in.</p>

<p>"I quite understand, my dear Heltzendorff," he
said, as in his cosy little den he took from the
Emperor's packet the picture of Fr√§ulein Elise and
stood gazing at it thoughtfully. "It is quite plain
why you should have been sent by His Majesty."</p>

<p>"Why. I don't understand. But His Majesty
told me that you would explain. The young lady
and her mother are friends of mine."</p>

<p>"Exactly. That's just it!" exclaimed the round-faced,
rather florid man whom I had once met before.
"You apparently know but little of them&mdash;eh?&mdash;or
you would not call them your friends!"</p>

<p>Those mysterious words surprised me, but I was
the more astounded when he continued:</p>

<p>"You of course know of those disgraceful anonymous
letters which have been continually arriving
at Court&mdash;of the Emperor's fury concerning them."</p>

<p>I replied in the affirmative, for, as a matter of fact,
for the past three months the whole Court had been
flooded with most abusive and disgraceful correspondence
concerning the camarilla that had again
sprung up around the Kaiser. The Emperor, the
Empress, the Crown-Prince and Princess, Prince
Eitel, Sophie Caroline, Prince Henry of Prussia and
others had received letters, most of them in typewriting,
containing the most intimate details of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
scandals concerning men and women around the
Emperor.</p>

<p>Fully a dozen of these letters addressed to the
Crown-Prince he had handed to me&mdash;letters denouncing
in some cases perfectly innocent people, destroying
the reputations of honest men and women, and
abusing the Heir to the Throne in an outrageous
manner.</p>

<p>On at least three occasions "Willie" had shown
me letters addressed to the Kaiser himself, and
intercepted by the Kaiserin, who, in consequence of
this flood of anonymous epistles that had produced
such a terrible sensation at Potsdam, had ordered
that all such letters found in the Imperial post-bag
should be handed at once to her.</p>

<p>The great War-Lord's feelings had been sorely
wounded by the vitriolic shafts, and his vanity much
injured by the boldness of the unknown letter-writer
who had dared to speak his mind concerning the
Eulenburg scandals, which Maximilian Harden had
some time before exposed in the <i>Zukunft</i>.</p>

<p>All Berlin was gossiping about the scandal of the
letters and the horrible innuendoes contained in them.
The <i>Allerh√∂chste Person</i>, though boiling over with
anger, blissfully believed that outside the Palaces
nothing was known of the contents of the correspondence.
But the Emperor, in his vanity, never
accurately gauges the mind of his people.</p>

<p>"The identity of the writer is the point that is
engaging my attention," the Baron said, as, seating
himself at his big, carved-oak writing-table, he
opened a drawer and drew forth a bundle of quite a
hundred letters, adding: "All these that you see
here have been addressed either to the Emperor or
the Empress," and he handed me one or two, which
on scanning I saw contained some outrageous statements,
allegations which would make the hair of the
All-Highest One bristle with rage.</p>

<p>"Well!" I exclaimed, aghast, looking up at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
Baron after I had read an abusive letter, which in
cold, even lines of typewriting commenced with the
words: "You, a withered crook in spectacular
uniform better fitted for the stage of the Metropol
Theatre, should, instead of invoking the aid of Providence,
clear out your own Augean stable. Its
smell is nauseous to the nostrils of decent people.
Surely you should blush to have feasted in the castle
of Liebenberg with the poet, Prince Philip, and your
degenerate companions, Hohenau, Johannes Lynar,
and your dearly beloved Kuno!"</p>

<p>And the abusive missive proceeded to denounce
two of my friends, ladies-in-waiting at the Neues
Palais, and to make some blackguardly allegations
concerning the idol. Von Hindenburg.</p>

<p>"Well," I exclaimed, "that certainly is a very
interesting specimen of anonymous correspondence."</p>

<p>"Yes, it is!" exclaimed the Baron. "In Berlin
every inquiry has been made to trace its author.
Schunke, head of the detective police, was charged
by the Emperor to investigate. He did so, and both
he and Klewitz failed utterly. Now it has been
given into my hands."</p>

<p>"Have you discovered any clue to the writer?"
I asked anxiously, knowing full well what a storm of
indignation those letters had produced in our own
circle.</p>

<p>Presently, when I sat with the Baron at his table,
he switched on an intense electric light, even though
it was day-time, and then spread out some of the
letters above a small, square mirror.</p>

<p>"You see they are on various kinds of note-paper,
bearing all kinds of watermarks, of French,
English, and German manufacture. Some we have
here are upon English paper, because it is heavy and
thick. Again, three different makes of typewriter
have been used&mdash;one a newly-invented importation
from America. The written letters are, you will
see, mostly in a man's hand."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, I see all that," I said. "But what have
you discovered concerning their author? The letter
I received bore a French stamp and the postmark
of Angers."</p>

<p>He placed before me quite a dozen envelopes
addressed to the Emperor and Empress, all bearing the
postmark of that town in the Maine-et-Loire. Others
had been posted in Leipzig, Wilhelmshaven, Tours,
Antwerp, Berlin-Wilmersdorf, and other places.</p>

<p>"The investigation is exceedingly difficult, I can
assure you," he said. "I have had the assistance of
some of the best scientific brains of our Empire in
making comparisons and analyses. Indeed, Professor
Harbge is with me from Berlin."</p>

<p>As he uttered those words the Professor himself,
an elderly, spectacled man in grey tweeds, entered
the room. I knew him and greeted him.</p>

<p>"We have been studying the writing-papers,"
the Professor said presently, as he turned over the
letters, some of which were upon commercial typewriting
paper, some on cheap thin paper from fashionable
"blocks," and others upon various tinted paper
of certain mills, as their watermarks showed. The
papers were various, but the scurrilous hand was the
clever and evasive one of some person who certainly
knew the innermost secrets of the German Court.</p>

<p>"Sixteen different varieties of paper have been
received at the Neues and Marmor Palaces," the
Baron remarked. "Well, I have worked for two
months, night and day, upon the inquiry, for, as you
know, the tentacles of our Teuton octopus are everywhere.
I have discovered that eleven of these
varieties of paper can be purchased at a certain
small stationer's shop, Lancry's, in the Boulevard
Haussmann, close to the 'Printemps.' One paper
especially is sold nowhere else in Paris. It is this."</p>

<p>And he held over a mirror a letter upon a small
sheet of note-paper bearing the watermark of a bull's
head.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>"That paper was made at a mill in the south of
Devonshire, in England, destroyed by fire five years
ago. Paper of that make cannot be obtained anywhere
else in France," he declared.</p>

<p>I at once realized how much patience must have
been expended upon the inquiry, and said:</p>

<p>"Then you have actually fixed the shop where the
writer purchased his paper?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied. "And we know that the
newly-invented typewriter, a specimen one, was sold
by the Maison Audibert, in Marseilles. The purchaser
of the typewriter in Marseilles purchases his
paper and envelopes at Lancry's, in the Boulevard
Haussmann."</p>

<p>"Splendid!" I said enthusiastically, for it was
clear that the Baron, with the thousand-and-one
secret agents at his beck and call, had been able, with
the Professor's aid, to fix the source of the stationery.
"But," I added, "what is wanted from me?"
Why, I wondered, had His Majesty sent the Baron
that photograph of Elise Breitenbach?</p>

<p>"I want you to go with me to the central door of
the 'Printemps' at four o'clock this afternoon, and we
will watch Lancry's shop across the way," the Baron
replied.</p>

<p>This we did, and from four till six o'clock we stood,
amid the bustle of foot passengers, watching the small
stationer's on the opposite side of the boulevard,
yet without result.</p>

<p>Next day and the next I accompanied the prosperous
cinema proprietor upon his daily vigil, but in vain,
until his reluctance to tell me the reason why I had
been sent to Paris annoyed me considerably.</p>

<p>On the fifth afternoon, just before five o'clock,
while we were strolling together, smoking and
chatting, the Baron's eyes being fixed upon the door
of the small single-fronted shop, I saw him suddenly
start, and then make pretence of utter indifference.</p>

<p>"Look!" he whispered beneath his breath.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>I glanced across and saw a young man just about
to enter the shop.</p>

<p>The figure was unfamiliar, but, catching sight of
his face, I held my breath. I had seen that sallow,
deep-eyed countenance before.</p>

<p>It was the young man who, two months previously,
had sat eating his luncheon alone at the "Esplanade,"
apparently fascinated by the beauty of little Elise
Breitenbach!</p>

<p>"Well," exclaimed the Baron. "I see you
recognize him&mdash;eh? He is probably going to buy
more paper for his scurrilous screeds."</p>

<p>"Yes. But who is he? What is his name?" I
asked anxiously. "I have seen him before, but
have no exact knowledge of him."</p>

<p>The Baron did not reply until we were back again
in the cosy room in Neuilly. Then, opening his
cigar-box, he said:</p>

<p>"That young man, the author of the outrageous
insults to His Majesty, is known as Franz Seeliger,
but he is the disgraced, ne'er-do-well son of General
von Trautmann, Captain-General of the Palace
Guard."</p>

<p>"The son of old Von Trautmann!" I gasped in
utter amazement. "Does the father know?"</p>

<p>The Baron grinned and shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>Then after I had related to him the incident at
the "Esplanade," he said:</p>

<p>"That is of greatest interest. Will you return to
Berlin and report to the Emperor what you have
seen here? His Majesty has given me that
instruction."</p>

<p>Much mystified, I was also highly excited that the
actual writer of those abominable letters had been
traced and identified. The Baron told me of the
long weeks of patient inquiry and careful watching;
of how the young fellow had been followed to Angers
and other towns in France where the letters were
posted, and of his frequent visits to Berlin. He had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
entered a crack regiment, but had been dismissed the
Army for forgery and undergone two years' imprisonment.
Afterwards he had fallen in with a gang of
clever international hotel thieves, and become what
is known as a <i>rat d'h√¥tel</i>. Now, because of a personal
grievance against the Emperor, who had ordered his
prosecution, he seemed to have by some secret
means ferreted out every bit of scandal at Potsdam,
exaggerated it, invented amazing additions, and in
secret sown it broadcast.</p>

<p>His hand would have left no trace if he had not
been so indiscreet as to buy his paper from that
one shop close to the Rue de Provence, where he
had rooms.</p>

<p>On the third night following I stood in the Emperor's
private room at Potsdam and made my
report, explaining all that I knew and what I had
witnessed in Paris.</p>

<p>"That man knows a very great deal&mdash;but how
does he know?" snapped the Emperor, who had
just returned from Berlin, and was in civilian attire,
a garb quite unusual to him. He had no doubt
been somewhere incognito&mdash;visiting a friend perhaps.
"See Schunke early to-morrow," he ordered, "and
tell him to discover the link between this young
blackguard and your friends the Breitenbachs, and
report to me."</p>

<p>I was about to protest that the Breitenbachs were
not my friends, but next instant drew my breath,
for I saw that the great War-Lord, even though he
wore a blue serge suit, was filled with suppressed
anger.</p>

<p>"This mystery must be cleared up!" he declared
in a hard voice, reflecting no doubt upon the terrible
abuse which the writer had heaped upon him, all
the allegations, by-the-way, having contained a
certain substratum of truth.</p>

<p>Next morning I sat with the bald-headed and
astute Schunke at the headquarters of the detective<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
police in Berlin, and there discussed the affair fully,
explaining the result of my journey to Paris and what
I had seen, and giving him the order from the Kaiser.</p>

<p>"But, Count, if this woman Breitenbach and her
pretty daughter are your friends you will be able
to visit them and glean something," he said.</p>

<p>"I have distinct orders from the Emperor not to
visit them while the inquiry is in process," I replied.</p>

<p>Schunke grunted in dissatisfaction, stroked his
iron-grey beard, but made no further comment.</p>

<p>We walked out together, and I left him at the door
of the Etat-major of the Army in the K√∂nigsplatz.</p>

<p>Later that same morning I returned to the Marmor
Palace to report to the Crown-Prince, but found that
His Highness was absent upon an official visit of
inspection at Stuttgart. The Marshal of the Court,
Tresternitz, having given me the information,
laughed, and added:</p>

<p>"Officially, according to to-day's newspapers, His
Highness is in Stuttgart, but unofficially I know that
he is at the Palace Hotel, in Brussels, where there is
a short-skirted variety attraction singing at the Eden
Theatre. So, my dear Heltzendorff, you can return
to the Krausenstrasse for a day or two."</p>

<p>I went back to Berlin, the Crown-Princess being
away at Wiesbaden, and from day to day awaited
"Willie's" return.</p>

<p>In the meantime I several times saw the great
detective, Schunke, and found that he was in constant
communication with Baron Steinmetz in Paris.
The pair were evidently leaving no stone unturned
to elucidate the mystery of those annoying letters,
which were still falling as so many bombs into the
centre of the Kaiser's Court.</p>

<p>Suddenly, one Sunday night, all Berlin was electrified
at the news that General von Trautmann,
Captain-General of the Palace Guard&mdash;whom, truth
to tell, the Crown-Prince had long secretly hated
because he had once dared to utter some word of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
reproach&mdash;had been arrested, and sent to a fortress
at the Emperor's order.</p>

<p>An hour after the arrest His Majesty's personal-adjutant
commanded me by telephone to attend at
the Berlin Schloss. When we were alone the Kaiser
turned to me suddenly, and said:</p>

<p>"Count von Heltzendorff, you will say nothing of
your recent visit to Paris, or of the authorship of
those anonymous letters&mdash;you understand? You
know absolutely nothing."</p>

<p>Then, being summarily dismissed by a wave of
the Imperial hand, I retired, more mystified than
ever. Why should my mouth be thus closed? I
dared not call at the Alsenstrasse to make my own
inquiries, yet I knew that the police had made theirs.</p>

<p>When I returned to my rooms that evening
Schunke rang me up on the telephone with the news
that my friends the Breitenbachs had closed their
house and left early that morning for Brussels.</p>

<p>"Where is Seeliger?" I inquired in great surprise.</p>

<p>"In Brussels. The Breitenbachs have gone there
to join him, now that the truth is out and his father
is under arrest."</p>

<p>The Emperor's fury was that of a lunatic. It
knew no bounds. His mind, poisoned against the
poor old General, he had fixed upon him as the
person responsible for that disgraceful correspondence
which for so many weeks had kept the Court
in constant turmoil and anxiety. Though His
Majesty was aware of the actual writer of the letters,
he would not listen to reason, and openly declared
that he would make an example of the silver-haired
old Captain-General of the Guard, who, after all, was
perfectly innocent of the deeds committed by his
vagabond son.</p>

<p>A prosecution was ordered, and three weeks later
it took place <i>in camera</i>, the Baron, Schunke and a
number of detectives being ordered to give evidence.
So damning, indeed, was their testimony that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
Judge passed the extreme sentence of twenty years'
imprisonment.</p>

<p>And I, who knew and held proofs of the truth,
dared not protest!</p>

<p>Where was the General's son&mdash;the real culprit and
author of the letters? I made inquiry of Schunke,
of the Baron, and of others who had, at the order
of the All-Highest, conspired to ruin poor Von Trautmann.
All, however, declared ignorance, and yet,
curiously enough, the fine house in the Alsenstrasse
still remained empty.</p>

<p>Later, I discovered that the Crown-Prince had been
the prime mover in the vile conspiracy to send the
elderly Captain-General to prison and to the grave,
for of this his words to me one day&mdash;a year afterwards&mdash;were
sufficient proof:</p>

<p>"It is a good job, Heltzendorff, that the Emperor
rid himself at last of that canting old pest, Von
Trautmann. He is now in a living tomb, and should
have been there four years ago!" and he laughed.</p>

<p>I made no response. Instead, I thought of the
quiet, innocent old courtier languishing in prison
because he had somehow incurred the ill-will of the
Emperor's son, and I confess that I ground my teeth
at my own inability to expose the disgraceful truth.</p>

<p>About six months after the secret trial of the
unfortunate General I had accompanied the Crown-Prince
on a visit to the Quirinal, and one afternoon
while strolling along the Corso, in Rome, suddenly
came face to face with the dainty little figure of
Fr√§ulein Elise Breitenbach.</p>

<p>In delight I took her into Ronzi's, the noted confectioner's
at the corner of the Piazza Colonna, and
there, at one of the little tables, she explained to me
how she and her mother, having become acquainted
with Franz Seeliger&mdash;not knowing him to be the
General's son&mdash;they suddenly fell under the suspicion
of the Berlin Secret Police, and, though much
puzzled, did not again come to Court.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>Some weeks later mother and daughter chanced to
be in Paris, and one day called at Seeliger's rooms
in the Rue de Provence, but he was out. They,
however, were shown into his room to wait, and there
saw upon his table an abusive and scurrilous typewritten
letter in German addressed to the Emperor.
Then it suddenly dawned upon them that the affable
young man might be the actual author of those
infamous letters. It was this visit which, no doubt,
revealed to the Baron the young man's hiding-place.
Both mother and daughter, however, kept their own
counsel, met Seeliger next day, and watched, subsequently
learning, to their surprise, that he was
the son of General von Trautmann, and, further,
that he had as a friend one of the personal valets of
the Emperor, from whom, no doubt, he obtained his
inside information about persons at Court.</p>

<p>"When his poor father was sentenced we knew
that the young man was living in Brussels, and at
once went there in order to induce him to come forward,
make confession, and so save the General from
disgrace," said the pretty girl seated before me.
"On arrival we saw him alone, and told him what
we had discovered in the Rue de Provence, whereupon
he admitted to us that he had written all the
letters, and announced that he intended to return
to Berlin next day and give himself up to the police
in order to secure his father's release."</p>

<p>"And why did he not do so?" I asked eagerly.</p>

<p>"Because next morning he was found dead in his
bed in the hotel."</p>

<p>"Ah, suicide."</p>

<p>"No," was her half-whispered reply. "He had
been strangled by an unknown hand&mdash;deliberately
murdered, as the Brussels police declared. They
were, of course, much mystified, for they did not
know, as we know, that neither the young man's
presence nor his confession were desired in Berlin."</p>

<p>Fearing the Emperor's wrath, the Breitenbachs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
like myself, dare not reveal what they knew&mdash;the
truth, which is here set down for the first time&mdash;and,
alas! poor General von Trautmann died in
prison at Mulheim last year.</p>

<h2><a name="SECRET_NUMBER_THREE" id="SECRET_NUMBER_THREE"></a>SECRET NUMBER THREE</h2>
<h3>HOW THE KAISER PERSECUTED A PRINCESS</h3>


<p>The truth of the dastardly plot which caused
the downfall of the unfortunate and much-maligned
Imperial Princess Luisa Antoinette Marie,
Archduchess of Austria, and wife of Friedrich-August,
now the reigning King of Saxony, has never yet been
revealed.</p>

<p>I know, my dear Le Queux, that you had a good
deal to do with the "skittish Princess," as she was
called, and her affairs after she had left the Court of
Saxony and went to live near you in the Via Benedetto
da Foiano, in Florence. You were her friend,
and you were afterwards present at her secret marriage
in London. Therefore, what I here reveal concerning
a disgraceful conspiracy by which a clever,
accomplished, and generous Princess of the blood
Royal was hounded out of Germany will, I think, be
of peculiar interest to yourself and to those readers
for whom you are setting down my reminiscences.</p>

<p>As you know, before being appointed to my recent
position in the Crown-Prince "Willie's" household,
I was personal-adjutant to His Majesty the Emperor,
and in that capacity accompanied Der Einzige (the
One) on his constant travels. Always hungry for
popular applause, the Emperor was ever on the move
with that morbid restlessness of which he is possessed,
and which drove him from city to city, hunting,
yachting, unveiling statues, opening public buildings,
paying ceremonial visits, or, when all excuses for
travel became exhausted, he presented new colours
to some regiment in some far-off garrison.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>Indeed, within that one year, 1902, I accompanied
"William-the-Sudden" and his host of adjutants,
military and civil secretaries, valets, chasseurs and
flunkeys, to twenty-eight different cities in Germany
and Scandinavia, where he stopped and held Court.
Some cities we visited several times, being unwelcome
always because of the endless trouble, anxiety and
expense caused to the municipal authorities and
military casinos.</p>

<p>I, of course, knew the charming Imperial Highness
the Crown-Princess Luisa of Saxony, as she often
came on visits to the Kaiserin, but I had never spoken
much with her until at Easter the Emperor went to
visit Dresden. He took with him, among other
people, one of his untitled boon companions, Judicial
Councillor L√∂hlein, a stout, flabby-faced hanger-on,
who at the time possessed great influence over him.
Indeed, he was really the Emperor's financial agent.
This man had, some time ago, very fortunately for the
Emperor, opened his eyes to the way in which Kunze
had manipulated the amazing Schloss Freiheit Lottery,
and had been able to point out to the All-Highest
One what a storm of ridicule, indignation and
defiance must arise in Berlin if he attempted to carry
out his huge reconstruction and building scheme.</p>

<p>I was present in the Emperor's room at Potsdam
when old L√∂hlein, with whom sat Herr von Wedell,
openly declared to the Emperor that if he prosecuted
his pet building scheme great indignation must arise,
not only in the capital, but in Hanover, Wiesbaden,
and Kassel.</p>

<p>The Kaiser knitted his brows and listened attentively
to both of his advisers. I well remember how,
next day, the Press, in order to allay the public dissatisfaction,
declared that the huge building projects
of the Emperor never existed. They had been purely
imaginary ideas put forward by a syndicate of speculative
builders and taken up by the newspapers.</p>

<p>Without doubt the podgy, fair-haired man in gold-rimmed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
spectacles, the Judicial Councillor L√∂hlein, by
crushing the Kaiser's mad scheme gained considerable
popularity in a certain circle. He was, however, a
man of exceptional craft and cunning, and during the
eight years or so he remained the intimate friend of
the Emperor he must have, by advising and looking
after the Imperial investments, especially in America,
amassed a great fortune.</p>

<p>On the occasion of our Easter visit to the Saxon
Court&mdash;a Court which, to say the least, was a most
dull and uninteresting one&mdash;we all went, as is the
custom there, to the shoot at the Vogelschiessen, a
large wooden bird made up of pieces which fall out
when hit in a vital part. The bird target is set up at
the Easter fair held close to Dresden, and on that
afternoon the whole Court annually go to try their
skill at marksmanship. We were a merry party.
The Emperor went with the old King and Queen of
Saxony, being accompanied by the Crown-Prince
Friedrich-August and the Crown-Princess Luisa,
merry, laughing, full of spirits, and unusually good-looking
for a Royalty.</p>

<p>The Saxon Royal Family all shot, and, thanks to
her father's tuition, the Crown-Princess knocked a
piece out of the bird at the first shot, which sent the
public wild with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Luisa was the most popular woman in Saxony, and
deservedly so, for hers had been a love match. Her
father, Ferdinand IV., Grand Duke of Tuscany, had,
at the suggestion of the Emperor Francis Joseph,
endeavoured to arrange a match between the Princess
and the man now known as "foxy" Ferdinand of
Bulgaria. With that object a grand <i>d√Æner de c√©r√©monie</i>
was held one night at the Imperial Castle of
Salzburg, and at that dinner Luisa, suspecting the
conspiracy, publicly insulted the Ruler of Bulgaria,
which for ever put an end to the paternal plans.</p>

<p>After her marriage to the Saxon Crown-Prince the
Kaiser, in one of his whimsical moods, became greatly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
attached to her because of her frankness, her love of
outdoor life, and her high educational attainments,
hence we often had her visiting at Potsdam or at the
Berlin Schloss. She was known to be one of the few
feminine Royalties in whom the Kaiser took the
slightest interest.</p>

<p>After our return from the public shooting to the
Royal Palace in Dresden, a banquet was, of course,
held in honour of the Emperor in that great hall
where, on the walls, the four estates are represented
by scenes from the history of the Emperor Henry I.</p>

<p>At the grand ball afterwards I found myself chatting
with Luisa, who, I recollect, wore a most charming
and artistic gown of sea-green chiffon, <i>d√©collet√©</i>, of
course, with pink carnations in her hair and a few
diamonds upon her corsage, as well as the Order of
St. Elizabeth and her magnificent rope of matched
pearls, which went twice round her neck and reached
to her knees&mdash;a historic set which had once belonged
to Marie Antoinette. She looked very charming, and,
in her frank way, asked me:</p>

<p>"How do you like my dress, Count? I designed
it myself," she added.</p>

<p>I complimented her upon it, but I afterwards heard
that the old King of Saxony had been horrified at the
lowness to which the bodice had been cut, and,
further, that every yard of green chiffon in Dresden had
been sold out before noon next day and the dress
copied everywhere.</p>

<p>As we stood chatting in a corner of the room,
watching the scene of unusual brilliancy because of
the Kaiser's presence, the Princess, turning to me, said
suddenly:</p>

<p>"Do you believe in omens, Count von Heltzendorff?"</p>

<p>"Omens!" I exclaimed, rather surprised at her
question. "Really, I'm afraid I am a little too
matter-of-fact to take such things seriously, your
Highness."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, a curious thing happened here about a
month ago," she said. "I was&mdash;&mdash;" At that
instant the Emperor, in the uniform of the 2nd Regiment
of Saxon Grenadiers, of which he was chief, and
wearing the Order of Crancelin of the House of
Saxony, strode up, and, standing before us
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Well, Luisa? What is the very interesting topic
of conversation, eh?" He had evidently overheard
her words about some curious thing happening, for,
laughing gaily, he asked; "Now, what did happen a
month ago?"</p>

<p>Her Imperial Highness hesitated, as though endeavouring
to avoid an explanation, but next second
she waved her lace fan quickly and said:</p>

<p>"Well, something remarkable. I will tell your
Majesty if you really wish to hear it."</p>

<p>"By all means, Luisa, by all means," replied His
Majesty, placing his sound hand behind his back and
drawing himself up very erect&mdash;a habit of his after
asking a question.</p>

<p>"Well, recently Friedrich-August and myself have
moved into rooms in the older wing of the Palace&mdash;rooms
that have not been occupied for nearly forty
years. They are old-world, charming, and remind me
constantly of Augustus the Strong and the times in
which he lived. Just about a month ago the King
and Queen of Roumania were paying us a visit. We
were at dinner, and while we were all laughing and
talking, for 'Carmen Sylva' had been telling us one
of her stories, we heard a great clatter of horses' hoofs
and the heavy rumble of wheels, just as though a stage
coach was crossing the Small Courtyard. All of us
listened, and in the silence we heard it receding quite
distinctly. I at once sent my lady-in-waiting to
ascertain who had arrived or departed, four-wheeled
coaches being quite unusual nowadays. It seemed
just as though the coach had driven out of the Palace
gate. The message brought back from the guardroom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
was that no carriage had entered or left. I told
this to those around the table, and the Queen of
Roumania, who had taken much interest in omens and
folk-lore, seated opposite me, seemed much impressed,
and even perturbed."</p>

<p>"Then the noise you heard must have been quite
an uncanny one, eh?" asked the Emperor, deeply
interested.</p>

<p>"Quite. Two of the women at the table declared
that it must have been thunder, and then the conversation
proceeded. I, however, confess to your
Majesty that I was very much puzzled, and the more
so because only two nights ago, while we sat at dinner
Friedrich-August and myself <i>en famille</i>, we heard
exactly the same sounds again!"</p>

<p>"Really!" laughed the Emperor. "Quite uncanny.
I hope, here in Dresden, you are not believing
in spooks, as London society believes in them."</p>

<p>"Not at all," said the Princess earnestly. "I
don't believe in omens. But, curiously enough, the
King told me yesterday that his two old aunts, who
formerly lived in our wing of the Palace, had sometimes
heard the clatter of horses' hoofs, the jingle of
harness, the grinding of the brakes, and the rumbling
of heavy carriage wheels."</p>

<p>"H'm!" grunted the Emperor. "I've heard that
same story before, Luisa. The departing coach
means trouble to the reigning family."</p>

<p>"That is exactly what the King said to me only
last evening," answered Luisa frankly. "Does it
mean trouble to me, I wonder?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not," I declared. "Your Imperial
Highness need not worry for one moment over such
things. Nobody nowadays regards such phenomena
as presage of evil. There is no doubt some perfectly
natural explanation of the sounds. Every old palace,
castle, and even private house, has its traditions."</p>

<p>"Quite right, Heltzendorff," laughed the Emperor,
"especially in England and Scotland. There they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
have white ladies, grey ladies, men with heads like
stags, lights in windows, the sound of mysterious
bells ringing, and all sorts of evil omens. Oh, those
dear, superstitious English! How ready they are
to take up anything unpractical that may be a pleasant
change to the senses."</p>

<p>"Your Majesty does not believe in omens?" I
ventured to remark.</p>

<p>"Omens!" he exclaimed, fixing his gaze upon me.
"No; none but cowards and old women believe
in them." Then, turning to the Princess, he smiled,
saying: "If I were you, Luisa, I would give your
chief of police orders to question all the servants.
Somebody rattled some dishes, perhaps. You say
it was during dinner."</p>

<p>But the pretty Crown-Princess was serious, for
she said:</p>

<p>"Well, all I can say is that not only did I myself
hear, but a dozen others at table also heard the noise
of horses, not dishes."</p>

<p>"Ah, Luisa! I see you are a trifle nervous,"
laughed the Emperor. "Well, as you know, your
Royal House of Saxony has lasted from the days of
Albert the Courageous in the early fifteenth century,
and the Dynasty of the Ravensteins has been
prosperous from then until to-day, so don't trouble
yourself further. Why, you are really quite pale and
unnerved, I see," His Majesty added, for nothing
escapes those shrewd, wide-open eyes of his.</p>

<p>Then the Emperor, after acknowledging the salute
of Baron Georg von Metzsch, Controller of the Royal
Household&mdash;a tall, thin, crafty-eyed man, with hair
tinged with grey, and wearing a dark blue uniform and
many decorations&mdash;changed the topic of conversation,
and referred to the Saxon Easter custom which that
morning had been carried out.</p>

<p>The Kaiser was in particularly merry mood that
night. He had gone to Dresden against his inclination,
for he had long ago arranged an Easter review<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
on the Tempelhofer Feld, but the visit was, I knew, for
the purpose of a consultation in secret with the King
of Saxony. A week before, in the Berlin Schloss, I
had been sent by the Emperor to obtain a paper from
his table in the upstairs study, and in looking for the
document in question&mdash;one that he had signed and
wished to send over to the Reichsamt des Innern
(Office of the Interior)&mdash;I came across a letter from
King George of Saxony, begging the Emperor to visit
him, in order to discuss "that matter which is so
seriously threatening the honour of our House."</p>

<p>Several times I wondered to what His Majesty of
Saxony had referred. That morning Emperor and
King had been closeted alone together for fully three
hours, and the outcome of the secret conference
seemed to have put the All-Highest into a most
excellent mood.</p>

<p>He left us, accompanied by Baron von Metzsch and
Judicial Councillor L√∂hlein, and I noticed how both
men were talking with the Emperor in an undertone.
To my surprise also I saw how L√∂hlein cast furtive
glances towards where I still stood with the Crown-Princess.</p>

<p>A few moments later, however, a smart officer of
the Prussian Guard, whom I recognized as Count von
Castell Rudenhausen, a well-known figure in the gay
life of Berlin, came forward, and, bowing, invited the
Princess to waltz.</p>

<p>And a moment later Luisa was smiling at me across
the shoulder of her good-looking cavalier.</p>

<p>Suddenly, while waltzing, her magnificent rope of
historic matched pearls accidentally caught in the
button of a passing officer, the string snapped, and
many of the pearls fell rattling upon the polished floor.</p>

<p>In a moment a dozen officers in tight uniforms were
groping about to recover them from the feet of the
dancers when, during the commotion, I heard the
voice of Judicial Councillor L√∂hlein remark quite
loudly:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah! now we can all see who are the Crown-Princess'
admirers!"</p>

<p>Luisa flushed instantly in anger and annoyance,
but said nothing, whilst her lady-in-waiting in silence
took the broken rope of pearls, together with those
recovered from the floor, and a few moments later the
significant incident ended.</p>

<p>The Saxon Crown-Prince and his wife were at that
time a most devoted couple, though all of us knew that
the modern ideas Luisa had brought to Dresden from
the Hapsburg Court had much shocked old King
George and his consort. The Saxon Court was unused
to a pretty woman with buoyant spirits rejoicing in
life with a capital "L." According to the Court
whisperings, trouble had started a few days after
marriage, when the King, having given his daughter-in-law
a tiara of diamonds, a Royal heirloom, with
strict injunctions to wear them just as they were&mdash;a
style of the seventeenth century&mdash;he one evening
at the opera saw her wearing the stones re-set in that
style known as <i>art nouveau</i>. The King became
furious, and ordered them to be set again in their
original settings, whereupon Luisa coolly returned the
present.</p>

<p>Such was the commencement of the old King's
ill-feeling towards her.</p>

<p>The State ball that night was certainly a brilliant
one for such a small Court, and next day we all returned
to Potsdam, for the Emperor had suddenly
cancelled a number of engagements and arranged to
pay a visit to Wilhelmshaven, where the Kaiserliche
Werft (Imperial Dockyard) contained certain naval
secrets he wished to see.</p>

<p>Before we left Dresden, however, I met the Crown-Princess
in one of the corridors. It was nine o'clock
in the morning. She wore her riding-habit, for, being
a splendid horsewoman, she had just come in from
her morning canter.</p>

<p>"Well, Count!" she laughed. "So you are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
leaving us unexpectedly! I shall be coming to pay
another visit to Potsdam soon. The Emperor invited
me last night. Au revoir!" And after I had bent
over her small white hand she waved it merrily and
passed the sentry towards her private apartments,
wherein she had heard the ghostly coach and four.</p>

<p>Her Imperial Highness paid her promised visit to
the Empress at the Neues Palais in July.</p>

<p>At the time of her arrival the Emperor had left
suddenly and gone away to Hubertusstock. When
anything unusual upset him he always went there.
I overheard him the day before his departure shouting
to L√∂hlein as I passed along one of the corridors.
The Judicial Councillor seemed to be trying to pacify
him, but apparently entirely without avail, for the
Emperor is a man not easily convinced.</p>

<p>"You are as sly as all the rest!" I heard the Emperor
declare in that shrill, high-pitched tone which
always denotes his anger. "I'll hear none of it&mdash;no
excuses. I want no fawning, no Jew-juggling."</p>

<p>Then, fearing to be discovered, I slipped on past
the door.</p>

<p>The next I heard was that the Kaiser had left for
that lonely retreat to which he went when he wished
to be alone in those periods of crazy impetuosity
which periodically seized the Mad Dog of Europe;
and, further, that he had taken with him his crafty
crony, L√∂hlein.</p>

<p>During that mysterious absence&mdash;when the tinselled
world of Potsdam seemed at peace&mdash;the good-looking
Saxon Crown-Princess arrived.</p>

<p>I was on duty on the railway platform to bow
over her hand and to welcome her.</p>

<p>"Ah! Count von Heltzendorff! Well, did I not
say that I should not be very long before I returned
to Potsdam, eh?" she exclaimed. Then, in a
whisper, she said with a merry laugh: "Do you
remember those clattering hoofs and my broken rope
of pearls? Nothing has happened yet."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>"And nothing will," I assured her as, with a
courtier's obeisance, I conducted Her Imperial Highness
to the Royal carriage, where the Crown-Prince
"Willie" was awaiting her, chatting with two officers
of the Guard to while away the time.</p>

<p>Three days later an incident occurred which caused
me a good deal of thought, and, truth to tell, mystified
me considerably.</p>

<p>That somewhat indiscreet journal, the <i>Milit√§r
Wochenblatt</i>, had published a statement to the effect
that Friedrich-August of Saxony and the handsome
Luisa had had a violent quarrel, a fact which caused
a great deal of gossip throughout Court circles.</p>

<p>Old Von Donaustauf, who at that time was master
of the ceremonies at the Emperor's Court, busied
himself by spreading strange scandals regarding the
Crown-Princess Luisa. Therefore, in the circumstances,
it struck me as strange that Her Highness
should have been invited to the puritanical and
hypocritical circle at Potsdam.</p>

<p>That afternoon, soon after the guard had been
changed, I chanced to be writing in my room, which
overlooked the big central courtyard, when I heard
the guard suddenly turn out in great commotion, by
which I knew that His Majesty had suddenly returned
from Hubertusstock.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later my telephone rang, and, passing
the sentries, I went by order to His Majesty's study,
that chamber of plots and secrets, hung with its
faded pale green silk damask, its furniture covered
with the same material, and its net curtains at the
windows threaded with ribbons of the same shade.</p>

<p>The moment I entered the Emperor's countenance
showed me that he was very angry. His low-bowing
crony, L√∂hlein, always a subtle adviser, had returned
with him, and stood watching the Emperor as the
latter impatiently paced the room.</p>

<p>I saluted, awaiting orders in silence, as was my
habit, but so preoccupied was His Majesty that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
did not notice my presence, but continued his outburst
of furious wrath. "Only see what Von Hoensbroech
has reported!" he cried, suddenly halting
against one of those big buhl chests of drawers with
grey marble tops&mdash;heavy pieces of furniture veneered
with tortoise-shell in which the Emperor keeps his
official papers. "I am being made a laughing-stock&mdash;and
you know it, L√∂hlein! It has been said of us
that a woman, a whim, or a word will to-day raise
any person to high rank in our Empire! That blackguard,
Harden, has actually dared to write it in his
journal. Well, we shall see. That woman&mdash;she
shall&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>As the Kaiser uttered those words he suddenly
realized that I was present, and hesitated. Next
second both his tone and his manner changed.</p>

<p>"Heltzendorff&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;wish you to go to Dresden
and take a private letter. It will be ready in half an
hour. Say nothing to anyone concerning your
departure, but report to me here at"&mdash;and he
glanced at the small bronze clock on the overmantel
between two elegant candelabra&mdash;"at four o'clock."</p>

<p>As commanded, I reported, but the Kaiser was
with the Empress, who, in one of her private apartments,
was holding <i>petit cercle</i>, the Princess Luisa being
present. Indeed, as I entered that semi-circular salon
the Kaiser was standing astride before Luisa's chair
laughing gaily with her. Surely none who saw him
at that moment would ever have believed that not
half an hour before his face had been blanched by
anger. He could alter his moods just as he changed
his three hundred odd uniforms.</p>

<p>There was something mysterious in the wind&mdash;of
that I felt absolutely convinced. The atmosphere
of that faded green upstairs room was always one of
confidential conversations, intimate conferences and
secret plots&mdash;plots despicable and vile, as has since
been proved&mdash;against the peace of the world.</p>

<p>The Emperor, noticing that I had entered the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
Imperial presence, came forward, and I followed him
back into the softly-carpeted corridor. Then his
action further aroused my curiosity, for he took from
the inner pocket of his tunic an envelope of what you
in England call "court" size&mdash;linen-lined, as are all
envelopes used by the Emperor for his private correspondence.
I saw it had been sealed in black by
his own hand. Then, as he handed it to me, he said:</p>

<p>"Go to Dresden as quickly as possible and obtain
a reply to this."</p>

<p>I clicked my heels together, and, saluting, left upon
my secret mission to the Saxon Court.</p>

<p>The letter was addressed to Baron Georg von
Metzsch at Dresden.</p>

<p>Next day, when I presented it to the tall, thin
Controller of the Household, who sat in his small but
cosy room in the Royal Palace, I saw that its contents
greatly puzzled him.</p>

<p>He wrote a reply, and as Imperial messenger
I returned at once to Potsdam, handing it to the
Emperor as he strode alone from the Shell Saloon,
through which he was passing after dinner.</p>

<p>He took it from my hand without a word. The
All-Highest never bestows thanks upon those who
obey his orders. It is, indeed, said to-day that
Hindenburg has never once, during his whole official
career, been verbally thanked by his Imperial Master.</p>

<p>The Emperor, with impatient fingers, tore open the
envelope, read its contents, and then smiled contentedly,
after which I went to old Von Donaustauf's
room, and, tired out by the long journey, smoked a
good cigar in his company.</p>

<p>Next day we were all back at the Berlin Schloss&mdash;for
we never knew from day to day where we might
be&mdash;Hamburg, Stuttgart, D√ºsseldorf or Danzig.</p>

<p>During the morning His Majesty inspected the
Berlin garrison in the Tempelhofer Feld, and the
Princess Luisa rode with him. That same afternoon,
while I was busy writing in the long room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
allotted to me in the Berlin Schloss, Her Imperial
Highness, to my surprise, entered, closing the door
quietly after her.</p>

<p>"Count von Heltzendorff, you have been on a
secret mission to that spy, Von Metzsch, in Dresden,
have you not?"</p>

<p>I rose, bowed, and without replying courteously
offered her a chair.</p>

<p>"Why do you not admit it?" she asked quickly.</p>

<p>"Princess, if the Emperor gives me orders to preserve
secrecy, then it is my duty to obey," I said.</p>

<p>"I know," she answered, and then I realized how
upset and nervous she seemed. "But Von Metzsch
hates me, and has put about all sorts of scandalous
reports concerning me. Ah! Count," she sighed,
"you do not know how very unhappy I am&mdash;how
I am surrounded by enemies!"</p>

<p>These words caused me much surprise, though I
had, of course, heard many unsavoury rumours
regarding her unhappy position at the Saxon Court.</p>

<p>"I much regret to hear that," I said. "But Your
Imperial Highness has also many friends, of whom
I hope I may be permitted to number myself."</p>

<p>"Ah! it is extremely good of you to say that&mdash;very
good. If you are really my friend, then you
can help me. You are in a position to watch and
discover what is in progress&mdash;the reason the Emperor
exchanges those constant confidences with Von
Metszch, the man who has twisted my husband
around his little finger, and who has, with my Lady-of-the-Bedchamber,
Frau von Fritsch, already
poisoned his mind against me. Ah!" she sighed
again, "you have no idea how much I have suffered!"</p>

<p>She seemed on the verge of a nervous crisis, for I
saw that in her fine eyes stood the light of unshed
tears, and I confess I was much puzzled, for I had
certainly believed, up to that moment, that she was
on excellent terms with her husband.</p>

<p>"But surely His Highness the Crown-Prince of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
Saxony does not believe any of those wicked
reports?" I said.</p>

<p>"Ah! Then you have heard. Of course, you
have. Von Metzsch has taken good care to let the
whole world know the lies that he and the Countess
Paule Starhemberg have concocted between them.
It is cruel!" she declared in a paroxysm of grief.
"It is wicked!"</p>

<p>"No, no. Calm yourself, Princess!" I urged
sympathetically. "I am at least your friend, and
will act as such should occasion arise."</p>

<p>"I thank you," she sighed in relief, and she put
out her hand, over which I bent as I took it in
friendship.</p>

<p>"Ah!" she exclaimed in a low voice. "I fear I
shall require the assistance of a friend very soon.
Do you recollect my broken pearls?"</p>

<p>And a few moments later she left my room.</p>

<p>Through all that day and the next I wondered
what sly, underhand work could be in progress.
I pitied the good-looking, unconventional Imperial
Princess who, because of her somewhat hoydenish
high spirits, had aroused the storm of anger and
jealousy in the Saxon Court. But the Hapsburgs had
ever been unfortunate in their loves.</p>

<p>On the day before the Crown-Princess's visit to the
Berlin Court was due to end, at about six o'clock in
the evening, I passed the sentries and ascended to
the Emperor's study with some papers I had been
going through regarding the reorganization of the
Stettin garrison. I was one of the very few persons
ever admitted to that wing of the Palace.</p>

<p>As I approached the door, treading noiselessly
upon the soft carpet, I heard voices raised excitedly,
the door being slightly ajar.</p>

<p>Naturally I halted. In my position I was able
to hear a great deal of Palace intrigue, but never
had I listened to a conversation that held me more
breathless than at that moment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>"Woman," cried the Emperor, "do you, then,
openly defy my authority?"</p>

<p>"What that crafty sycophant, Von Metzsch, has
told you is, I repeat, a foul and abominable lie,"
was the reply.</p>

<p>And I knew that the unfortunate Princess was
defending her reputation, which her enemies at the
Court of Saxony had torn to shreds.</p>

<p>"No woman ever admits the truth, of course,"
sneered the Emperor. "I consider you a disgrace
to the Dresden Court."</p>

<p>"So this is the manner in which you openly insult
your guests!" was the Princess's bitter retort.
"You, who believe yourself the idol of your people,
now exhibit yourself in your true light as the
traducer of a defenceless woman!"</p>

<p>"How dare you utter those words to me!" cried
the All-Highest One, in fury.</p>

<p>"I dare defend myself&mdash;even though you may be
Emperor," replied Luisa, in a cold, hard tone of
defiance. "I repeat that your allegations are
untrue, and that you have no right to make them.
Surely you can see that my enemies, headed by
the King of Saxony, are all conspiring to effect
my downfall. I know it! I have written proof
of it!"</p>

<p>"Bosh! You say that because you know that
the statements are true!"</p>

<p>"You lie!" she cried fiercely. "They are not
true. You cannot prove them."</p>

<p>"Very well," answered the Emperor in that tone
of cold determination that I knew too well. "I
will prove the charges to my entire satisfaction."</p>

<p>I was startled at the manner in which the Princess
had dared to call the Emperor a liar. Surely nobody
had ever done so before.</p>

<p>I drew a long breath, for as I crept away unseen
I recollected the Kaiser's unrelenting vindictiveness.</p>

<p>Poor Princess! I knew that the red talons of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
Hohenzollern eagle would sooner or later be laid
heavily upon her.</p>

<p>She left Berlin two hours later, but half an hour
before her departure I found a hurriedly-scribbled
note upon my table explaining that she had had
"a few unpleasant words with the Emperor," and
that she was leaving for Dresden a day earlier than
had been arranged.</p>

<p>A fortnight passed. Twice Baron von Metzsch
came to Potsdam, and was on each occasion closely
closeted with the Emperor, as well as having frequent
consultations with Judicial Councillor L√∂hlein. I
had strong suspicion that the vile conspiracy against
the lively daughter of the Hapsburgs was still in
progress, for I felt assured that the Kaiser would
never forgive those words of defiance from a woman's
lips, and that his vengeance, slow and subtle, would
assuredly fall upon her.</p>

<p>I did not know at the time&mdash;not, indeed, until
fully three years later&mdash;how the blackguardly actions
of Von Metzsch, who was a creature of the Kaiser, had
from the first been instigated by the All-Highest,
who, from the very day of the Prince's marriage, had,
notwithstanding his apparent graciousness towards
her, determined that a Hapsburg should never become
Queen of Saxony.</p>

<p>For that reason, namely, because the Emperor in
his overweening vanity believes himself to be the
Heaven-sent ruler of the destinies of the German
Empire, was much opposed to an Austrian princess
as a potential queen at Dresden, he set himself
the task to ruin the poor woman's life and love and
to arouse such a terrible scandal concerning her that
she could not remain in Saxony with every finger
pointing at her in opprobrium and scorn.</p>

<p>A fresh light, however, was thrown upon what I
afterwards realized to be a dastardly conspiracy by
the receipt of a cipher message late one November
night at Potsdam. I was at work alone with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
Emperor in the pale green upstairs room, reading and
placing before him a number of State documents to
which he scrawled his scribbly signature, when the
telegram was brought.</p>

<p>"Decipher that, Heltzendorff," he commanded,
and went on with the work of reading and signing the
documents, while I sat down with the red leather-covered
personal code book which bore the Imperial
coronet and cipher, and presently found that the
message, which was from Dresden, read:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Frau von Fritsch to-day had an interview with
Giron, the French tutor to the Crown-Princess's
children, but unfortunately the latter refuses to admit
any affection for Luisa. Giron angrily declared his
intention to leave Dresden, because of Von Fritsch's
suggestion. This course, I saw, would be unfortunate
for our plans, therefore I urged the King to induce
Luisa to request him to remain. She has done so,
but to no avail, and Giron left for Brussels to-night.
May I be permitted to come to discuss with your
Majesty a further elaboration of the plan?&mdash;<span class="smcap">Von
Metzsch</span>."</p></blockquote>

<p>The Emperor read the secret message twice. Then
he paused, with knit brows, and brushed his moustache
with his hand, a habit of his when perplexed.</p>

<p>"We go to Erfurt to-morrow, do we not?" he
said. "Telegraph in cipher to Von Metzsch to meet
us there to-morrow evening at seven. And destroy
that message," he added.</p>

<p>I obeyed his orders, and afterwards continued to
deal with the State papers, much enlightened by the
news transmitted by the Emperor's creature.</p>

<p>The Imperial hand was slowly destroying the
conjugal happiness of a pair who really loved each
other, even though they were of the blood royal.
The long arm of the Emperor was outstretched to
crush and pulverize the soul of the woman who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
dared to defend herself&mdash;who had defied the imperious
will of that man whose hand he had, with
awful blasphemy in addressing his Brandenburgers,
declared to be the hand of God.</p>

<p>I confess that I felt the deepest sympathy for the
helpless victim. At the Schloss, high above the old-world
town of Erfurt, the sneaking sycophant
Von Metzsch had a long conference with the Emperor
but I was unable to overhear any word of it. All I
know is that the Controller of the Saxon Household
left Erfurt for Dresden by special train at midnight.</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour after the Saxon functionary
had departed I was with the Emperor receiving orders
for the following day, and found him in high spirits,
by which, knowing him so intimately, I knew that he
was confident in his ultimate triumph.</p>

<p>Poor, defenceless Luisa! You, my dear Le Queux,
to whom the Princess a few months afterwards flew
for advice, know well how sterling, how womanly and
honest she was; how she was one victim of many of
the unholy, unscrupulous intrigues by which the
arrogant War-Lord of Germany, aided by his devil's
spawn, has until the present managed to retain his
now tottering throne.</p>

<p>Well, I watched the course of events; watched
eagerly and daily. Twice I had received letters
from Her Imperial Highness, short notes in her
firm, bold handwriting.</p>

<p>From Von Metzsch came several cipher messages to
the Emperor after we had returned to Potsdam, but
Zorn von Bulach, my colleague, deciphered all of
them, and, as he was not my friend, I did not inquire
as to their purport. I knew, however, that matters
in Dresden were fast approaching a crisis, and that
the unfortunate Hapsburg Princess could no longer
sustain the cruel and unjust pressure being put upon
her for her undoing. That a hundred of Germany's
spies and <i>agents-provocateurs</i> were busy I realized
from the many messages by telephone and telegraph<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
passing between Berlin and Dresden, and I felt
certain that the ruin of poor Princess Luisa was
nigh.</p>

<p>A significant message came to Potsdam late one
December night&mdash;a message which, when I deciphered
it and handed it to the Emperor, caused him to smile
in triumph.</p>

<p>I bit my lip. The Princess had left Dresden!</p>

<p>Three days later, on December 9th, a further
cipher telegram came from Von Metzsch, the Emperor's
sycophant in Dresden, which read: "Luisa has
learnt of the Sonnenstein project, and has left Salsburg
for Zurich, her brother accompanying.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Von
Metzsch</span>."</p>

<p>Sonnenstein! That was a private lunatic asylum!
I held my breath at the awful fate which the Emperor
had decided should be hers.</p>

<p>In a few moments the Kaiser had summoned, by
his private telephone, Koehler, then chief of the
Berlin secret police, and given orders that the Princess
was to be watched in Switzerland. Half an hour
later three police agents were on their way to Zurich
to follow and persecute the poor, distracted woman,
even beyond the confines of the Empire.</p>

<p>She was, no doubt, in deadly fear of being sent to
a living tomb, so that her mouth should be closed
for ever.</p>

<p>The Emperor, not content with casting her out of
Germany, intended to wreak a terrible and fiendish
revenge upon her by closing her lips and confining her
in an asylum. She knew that, and seeing herself
surrounded by enemies and spies on every hand&mdash;for
even her brother Leopold, with whom she had
travelled to Switzerland, now refused to assist her&mdash;she
adopted the only method of further escape that
at the moment presented itself.</p>

<p>Alone and without anyone to advise her, she, as
you know, took a desperate resolve, one, alas! fraught
with disastrous consequences.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>The iron had indeed entered the poor Princess's
soul.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Note by William Le Queux</span></p>

<p><i>The d√©nouement of this base intrigue of the Emperor's
will be best related in Her Imperial Highness's own
words. In one of her letters, which I have on my table
as I write, she says:</i></p>

<p><i>"I saw before me in those never-to-be-forgotten days
all the horrors of a 'Maison de Sant√©.' What could I
do? I was friendless in a strange hotel. Even
Leopold seemed disinclined to be further troubled by
a runaway sister. I knew Frau von Fritsch, that
unscrupulous liar, had accused me falsely of having
secret love affairs, and that the Emperor had directed
the whole plot which was to culminate in my confinement
in an asylum. Suddenly a solution occurred to
me. I remembered that Monsieur Giron, who had
already suffered greatly through his friendship with me.
If he joined me, then my flight from Dresden would be
considered as an elopement, and I should escape a living
death in a madhouse! Monsieur Giron was at that
moment my only friend, and it was for that reason that
I telegraphed to him at Brussels. Well, he joined me,
and by doing so completed the Emperor's triumph."</i></p>

<p><i>The subtle, ever-scheming Madman of Europe,
warped as he is in soul as in body, had, with his true
Hun craftiness and unscrupulousness, aided by Judicial
Councillor L√∂hlein and the spy Von Metzsch, succeeded
in hounding down an honest, defenceless woman as
high born as his own diseased self, and casting her in
ignominy and shame out of his now doomed Empire.</i></p>

<h2><a name="SECRET_NUMBER_FOUR" id="SECRET_NUMBER_FOUR"></a>SECRET NUMBER FOUR</h2>
<h3>THE MYSTERIOUS FRAU KLEIST</h3>


<p>The clever intrigues of Frau Kleist were unknown
to any outside the Court circle at Potsdam.</p>

<p>She was indeed a queer personage, "only less of a
personality than His Majesty," as that shiftiest of
German statesmen, Prince B√ºlow, declared to me
one day as we sat together in my room in the Berlin
Schloss.</p>

<p>Frau Kleist was the Court dancing-mistress, whose
fastidious judgment had to be satisfied by any young
d√©butante or officer before they presumed to dance
before Royalty at the State balls. Before every ball
Frau Kleist held several dance rehearsals in the
Weisser-Saal (White Salon) at the Berlin Schloss,
and she was more exacting than any pompous
General on parade. Perhaps she was seventy. Her
real age I never knew. But, friends that we were,
she often chatted with me and deplored the flat-footedness
of the coming generation of Teutons, and
more than once I have seen her lift her skirts and,
displaying neat silk-stockinged ankles on the polished
floor of the Weisser-Saal, make, for the benefit of
the would-be d√©butantes, graceful tiptoe turns with
a marvellous grace of movement.</p>

<p>Truly Frau Kleist, with her neat waist and thin,
refined face, was a very striking figure at the Berlin
Court. The intricacies of the minuet and gavotte,
as well as those of the old-world dances in which she
delighted, were taught by the old lady to Prince
Joachim and Princess Victoria Luise, both of whom
always went in deadly fear of her caustic tongue and
overbearing manner.</p>

<p>The Emperor never permitted any dancing at Court<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
which was not up to a high standard of excellence,
and all who sought to dance were compelled to pass
before the critical eye of the sharp-tongued old lady
in her stiff silken gown.</p>

<p>Once, I remember, certain young people of the smart
set of Berlin sought to introduce irregularities in the
Lancers, but they soon discovered that their cards
were cancelled.</p>

<p>Whence she had come or who had been responsible
for her appointment nobody knew. One thing was
quite certain, that though at an age when usually
rheumatism prevents agility, yet she was an expert
dancer. Another thing was also certain, that, if a
d√©butante or a young military elegant were awkward
or flat-footed, she would train them privately in the
Terpsichorean art, especially in the old-world dances
which are so popular at Court, and, accepting a little
palm-oil, would then pass them&mdash;after squeezing
them sufficiently&mdash;as fit to receive the Imperial
command to the Court balls.</p>

<p>The old woman, sharp-featured and angular as
became her age, with her complexion powdered and
rouged, lived in considerable style in a fine house
close to the Glienicke Bridge at Potsdam, beneath the
Babelsberg, a power to be reckoned with by all who
desired to enter the Court circle.</p>

<p>Regarding her, many strange stories were afloat.
One was that she was an ex-dancer, the mother of
the famous Mademoiselle "Clo-Clo" Durand,
<i>premi√®re danseuse</i> of the Paris Opera, and another
was that she had been mistress of the ballet
at the Imperial Opera in Petrograd in the days of
the Emperor Alexander. But so great a mystery
were her antecedents that nobody knew anything for
certain, save that, at the age of nearly seventy, she
had access at any hour to the Kaiser's private cabinet.
I have often seen her whisper to His Majesty strange
secrets which she had picked up here and there&mdash;secrets
that were often transferred to certain confidential<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
quarters which control the great Teuton
octopus.</p>

<p>Those at Court who secured the benignant smiles
of Frau Kleist knew that their future path in life
would be full of sunshine, but woe betide those upon
whom she knit her brows in disapproval. It was all
a question of bribery. Frau Kleist kept her pretty
house and her big Merc√©d√®s car upon the secret
money payments she received from those who "for
value" begged her favours. With many young
officers the payment to Frau Kleist was to open the
back door to the Emperor's favour.</p>

<p>We in the Neues Palais (New Palace) knew it.
But surely it did not concern us, for all of us looked
askance at those who strove so strenuously and
eagerly for "commands" to Court functions, and
really we were secretly glad if the parvenus of both
sexes were well bled before they were permitted by
Frau Erna to make their obeisance before Royalty.</p>

<p>The palace world at every European Court is a
narrow little world of its own, unknown and unsuspected
by the man in the street. There one sees
the worst side of human nature without any leaven of
the best or even nobler side. The salary-grabber, the
military adventurer, the pinchbeck diplomat, the
commercial parvenu, and the scientist, together with
their heavy-jowled, jewel-bedecked women-folk, elbow
each other in order to secure the notice of the All-Highest
One, who, in that green-upholstered private
room wherein I worked with him, often smiled at the
unseemly bustle while he calmly discriminated among
men and women according to their merits.</p>

<p>It is in that calm discretion that the Emperor
excels, possessing almost uncanny foresight, combined
with a most unscrupulous conscience.</p>

<p>"I know! Frau Kleist has told me!" were the
words His Majesty used on many occasions when I
had ventured perhaps to express doubt regarding
some scandalous story or serious allegation. Therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
I was confident, even though a large section of
the entourage doubted it, that the seventy-year-old
dancing-mistress, whose past was a complete mystery,
was an important secret agent of the Emperor's.</p>

<p>And what more likely? The Kaiser, as ruler of
that complex empire, would naturally seek to know
the truth concerning those who sought his favour
before they were permitted to click their heels or wag
their fans and bow the knee in his Imperial presence.
And he had, no doubt, with that innate cunning,
appointed his creature to the position of Court
dancing-mistress.</p>

<p>The most elegant, corsetted Prussian officer, even
though he could dance divinely, was good-looking
and perfectly-groomed, would never be permitted to
enter the Court circle unless a substantial number of
marks were placed within the old woman's palm. It
was her perquisite, and many in that ill-paid entourage
envied her her means of increasing her income.</p>

<p>In no Court in Europe are the purse-strings held so
tightly as in that of Potsdam. The Emperor and
Empress, though immensely wealthy, practise the
economy of London suburbia. But at every Court
bribery is rife in order to obtain Royal warrants and
dozens of other small favours of that kind, just as
open payment is necessary to-day to obtain titles of
nobility. The colour of gold has a fascination which
few can resist. If it were not so there would be no
war in progress to-day.</p>

<p>On October 17th, 1908, I had returned with the
Emperor and his suite from Hamburg, where His
Majesty had been present at the launching of one of
Herr Ballin's monster American liners, and at three
o'clock, after the Kaiser had eaten a hurried luncheon,
I was seated at the side table in his private room in
the Berlin Schloss, taking down certain confidential
instructions which he wished to be sent at once by one
of the Imperial couriers to the commandant of Posen.</p>

<p>Suddenly Von Kahlberg, my colleague, entered with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
a message that had been taken by the telegraphist
attached to the Palace, and handed it to His Majesty.</p>

<p>Having read it, the Kaiser at once grew excited, and,
turning to me, said:</p>

<p>"The Crown-Prince sends word from Potsdam that
the American, Orville Wright, is flying on the Bornstedter
Feld. We must go at once. Order the cars.
And, Von Kahlberg, inform Her Majesty at once.
She will accompany us, no doubt."</p>

<p>Quickly I placed before His Majesty one of his
photographs&mdash;knowing that it would be wanted for
presentation to the daring American&mdash;and he took up
his pen and scrawled his signature across it. Afterwards
I placed it in the small, green-painted dispatch-box
of steel which I always carried when in attendance
upon His Imperial Majesty.</p>

<p>Within a quarter of an hour three of the powerful
cars were on their way to Potsdam, the Emperor with
Herr Anton Reitschel&mdash;a high German official at
Constantinople&mdash;and Professor Vamb√©ry, who happened
to be at the Palace at the time, in the first car;
the Kaiserin with her daughter, Victoria Luise, and
the latter's <i>ober-gouvernante</i> (governess), with one of
the Court ladies, in the next; while in the third I
rode with Major von Scholl, one of the equerries.</p>

<p>Cheers rose from the crowds as we passed through
the Berlin streets, and the Emperor, full of suppressed
excitement at the thought of seeing an aeroplane
flight, constantly saluted as we flew along.</p>

<p>On arrival at the Bornstedter Feld it was already
growing dusk, and a great disappointment awaited us.
The Crown-Prince rode up to inform us gravely that
the flying was over for the day. At this the Kaiser
grew angry, for he had been out once before upon a
wild-goose chase, only to find that Orville Wright
had gone home, declaring the wind to be too strong.</p>

<p>At his father's anger, however, "Willie" burst out
laughing, declaring that he was only joking, and that
all was in readiness. Indeed, as he spoke the aviator,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
in his leather jacket, came up, and I presented him to
His Majesty, while from everywhere soldiers and police
appeared, in order to keep back the crowd to the road.</p>

<p>Then, while we stood alone in the centre of the great,
sandy plain, Mr. Orville Wright clambered into his
machine and, rising, made many circuits high
above us.</p>

<p>The Emperor stood with Herr Reitschel and the
shaggy old Professor, straining his eyes with keenest
interest. It was the first time His Majesty had seen
an aeroplane in flight. Much had been promised of
old Von Zeppelin's invention, yet the German public
had, until those demonstrations by the American
aviator, taken but little heed of the heavier-than-air
machine. At that time, indeed, the Emperor had
not taken up Von Zeppelin, and it was only after seeing
Orville Wright's demonstrations that he entered with
any enthusiasm into aeronautical problems.</p>

<p>High above us against the clear evening sky, wherein
the stars had already begun to twinkle, the daring
American rose, dipped, and banked, his machine
droning like a huge gad-fly, much to the interest and
astonishment of the Emperor.</p>

<p>"Marvellous!" he exclaimed, as I stood beside him,
with the Empress on his right. "How is it done?"</p>

<p>The crowds went wild with enthusiasm. The sight
of a man flying in the air, man&oelig;uvring his machine
at will, rising swiftly, and then planing down with
the engine cut off, was one of the most amazing
spectacles the loyal Potsdamers had ever seen. Even
the Emperor, with all his wild dreams of world-power,
could never for a moment have foreseen what a great
factor aeroplanes would be in the war which he was
so carefully plotting.</p>

<p>At last Wright came down in a spiral, banked
slightly, steadied himself, and then came lightly to
earth within a few yards of where we stood, having
been the first to exhibit to the great War-Lord how
completely the air had been conquered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, quiet, rather unassuming man that he was,
he advanced to receive the Imperial congratulations,
and to be handed the signed photograph which, at
the proper moment, I produced like a conjurer from
my dispatch-box. Afterwards, though it had now
grown dark, the Emperor, by the powerful headlamps
of the three cars, thoroughly examined the
American's aeroplane, the aviator explaining every
detail.</p>

<p>From that moment for months afterwards the
Kaiser was constantly talking of aviation. He commanded
photographs of various types of aeroplanes,
together with all literature on the subject, to be
placed before him. Indeed, he sent over to Britain,
in secret, two officers to attend the aeroplane meetings
held at Doncaster and Blackpool, where a large
number of photographs were secretly taken, and duly
found their way to his table.</p>

<p>Indeed, it would greatly surprise your English
friends, my dear Le Queux, if they had only seen the
many secret reports and secret photographs of all
kinds regarding Britain's military, naval, and social
life, which I have found upon the Emperor's table.</p>

<p>During my appointment I had through my hands
many amazing reports concerning the financial and
social position of well-known English politicians and
officials, reports made with one ulterior motive&mdash;that
of attempted bribery. The Emperor meant
war, and he knew that before he could hope for
success he must thoroughly "Germanize" Great
Britain&mdash;with what result we all now know.</p>

<p>I have recalled the Emperor's first sight of an
aeroplane in flight, in company with Herr Anton
Reitschel and Professor Vamb√©ry, because of an incident
which occurred that same day. Just before
midnight the Emperor, seated in his room in the
Berlin Schloss, was giving me certain instructions
to be sent to Carlton House Terrace, when the door
opened without any knock of permission, and upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
the threshold there stood that arch-intriguer, Frau
Kleist, in her stiff black silk gown, and wearing a
gleaming diamond brooch, the glitter of which was
cold as her own steely eyes.</p>

<p>"Have I Your Majesty's permission to enter?"
she asked, in her high-pitched voice.</p>

<p>"Of course, of course," replied the Emperor, turning
in his chair. "Come in and close the door. It
has turned quite cold to-night. Well?" he asked,
looking at her inquiringly.</p>

<p>The Emperor is a man of very few words, except
when he tells a story.</p>

<p>The Court dancing-mistress hesitated for a second.
Their eyes met, and in that glance I saw complete
understanding.</p>

<p>"May I speak in confidence with Your Majesty?"
she asked, advancing into the room, her stiff, wide
skirts rustling. Except the Court ladies she was the
only female at Court whom the sentries stationed at
the end of the corridor allowed to pass to His Majesty's
private cabinet.</p>

<p>But Frau Kleist had access everywhere. Her eyes
were the eyes of the Emperor. Many a diplomat,
financier, military or naval commander has been
raised to position of favourite because he first
secured&mdash;by payment, of course, according to his
means&mdash;the good graces of the <i>ex-ballerina</i>. And,
alas! many a good, honest man has been cast out
of the Potsdam circle into oblivion, and even to death,
because of the poisonous declaration of that smiling,
bejewelled old hag.</p>

<p>"Of what do you wish to speak?" inquired the
Emperor, who, truth to tell, was very busy upon a
most important matter concerning the building of
new submarines, and was perhaps a little annoyed by
the intrusion, though he did not betray it, so clever
was he.</p>

<p>"Of the Reitschel affair," was the old woman's
low reply.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>At her words the Kaiser frowned slightly, and
dismissed me. I bowed myself out, and closed the
door upon the Emperor and his clever female spy.</p>

<p>That she should have at that late hour come from
Potsdam&mdash;for, looking down into the courtyard, I
saw the lights of her big Merc√©d√®s&mdash;showed that some
underhand work was in progress.</p>

<p>Only a week before I had been discussing Anton
Reitschel and his position with my intimate friend,
old Von Donaustauf, Master of Ceremonies, who was
supposed to control the ex-dancer, but who in reality
was in a subordinate position to her, because she had
the ear of the Emperor at any hour. Petty jealousies,
dastardly plots, and constant intrigues make up the
daily life around the Throne. Half the orders given
in the Emperor's name are issued without his knowledge,
and many an order transmitted to the provinces
without his authority.</p>

<p>By handling, as I did, hundreds of those secret
reports which reached the Emperor I had learned
much concerning Herr Anton Reitschel, and from old
Von Donaustauf I had also been able to obtain
certain missing links concerning the intrigue.</p>

<p>Reitschel, a burly, round-faced, fair-haired Prussian
of quite superior type, held the position of Chief
Director of the German-Ottoman Bank in Constantinople.
His duty for the past three years had
been to conciliate the Sultan and to lend German
money to any industrial enterprise in which any grain
of merit could possibly be discovered. He had been
singled out, taken from the Dresdner Bank, and sent
to Constantinople by the Kaiser in order to play
Germany's secret game in Turkey&mdash;especially that
of the Bagdad Railway&mdash;and to combat with German
gold Great Britain's diplomacy with Tewfik Pasha
and old Abdul Hamid, in view of "The Day," which
the Emperor had long ago determined should soon
dawn. Was he not the War-Lord? And must not
a War-Lord make war?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>As old Von Donaustauf had put it, between the
whiffs of one of those exquisite cigarettes, a consignment
of the Sultan's own which came from the Yildiz
Kiosk to Potsdam weekly:</p>

<p>"Our Emperor intends that, notwithstanding
Britain's policy in the Near East, Germany shall soon
rule from Berlin to Bagdad. Herr Reitschel is in
reality charged with the work of "Germanizing" the
Ottoman Empire."</p>

<p>That I already knew by the many secret reports
of his which arrived so constantly from Constantinople,
reports which showed quite plainly that though
the great German Embassy, with its huge eagles of
stone set at each end, might have been built for the
purpose of impressing the Turks, yet the shrewd, farseeing
Herr Anton, as head of that big financial
corporation, held greater sway at that rickety set of
offices known to us as the Sublime Porte than did his
Excellency the Ambassador, with all his beribboned
crowd of underlings.</p>

<p>Truly the game which the Emperor was playing in
secret against the other Powers of Europe was a
crooked and desperate one. On the one hand the
Kaiser was making pretence of fair dealing with
Great Britain and France, yet on the other his agent,
Herr Reitschel, was ever busy lending money in all
directions, and bribing Turkish officials in order to
secure their favour in Germany's interest.</p>

<p>Yet a further game was being played&mdash;one that, in
addition to the Imperial Chancellor, I alone knew&mdash;namely,
that while the Kaiser was making pretence
of being the best friend of the Sultan Abdul Hamid,
visiting Constantinople and Palestine, building fountains,
endowing institutes, and bestowing his Imperial
grace in so many ways, yet he was also secretly
supporting the Young Turk party so as to effect the
Sultan's downfall as part of his sly, Machiavellian
policy&mdash;a plot which, as you know, ultimately succeeded,
for poor old Abdul the Damned and his harem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
were eventually packed off, bag and baggage, to
Salonika, notwithstanding His Majesty's wild entreaty
to Berlin for protection.</p>

<p>I happened to be with the Emperor on the Imperial
yacht at Troms√∂ when he received by telegram the
personal appeal addressed to him from his miserable
dupe, and I well recollect how grimly he smiled as he
remarked to me that it needed no response.</p>

<p>Well, at the period of which I am making the
present disclosure, Herr Anton had been paying a
number of flying visits to Berlin, and had had many
private audiences of both Kaiser and Sultan, and had
on several occasions been invited informally to the
Imperial luncheon table, a mark of esteem bestowed
by the Kaiser upon those who may at the moment be
serving his interests particularly well.</p>

<p>Suddenly all of us were surprised by the announcement
that the Kaiser's favoured civilian in Turkey
had married Mademoiselle Julie de Lagarenne,
daughter of Paul de Lagarenne, son of the great
French sugar refiner, and secretary of the French
Embassy at Rome. We heard also that, having
married in Italy, he was bringing his wife to Berlin.
Indeed, a week after that news was spread I met them
both in Kranzler's in Unter den Linden, and there he
introduced me to a pretty, dark-haired, vivacious
young Frenchwoman, who spoke German well, and
who told me that her husband had already given in
her name for presentation at the next Court.</p>

<p>That was about a month prior to Orville Wright's
flight and the midnight visit of Frau Kleist to the
Emperor.</p>

<p>Truth to tell, the old woman's mention of Herr
Reitschel's name caused me considerable misgivings,
because three weeks before I had gathered certain
strange facts from a secret report of a spy who in
Constantinople had been set to watch Herr Reitschel's
doings. That spy was Frau Kleist's son.</p>

<p>The Kaiser trusts nobody. Even his favourites<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
and most intimate cronies are spied upon, and
reports upon those familiar blue papers are furnished
regularly. In view of what I had read in that
report from Karl Kleist, I stood amazed when, at the
grand Court a week later, I had witnessed Herr
Reitschel's French wife bow before the Emperor and
Empress and noticed how graciously the Kaiser had
smiled upon her. Truly the Emperor is sphinx-like
and imperturbable. Outside the privacy of his own
room, that chamber of cunning plots and fierce
revenge, he never allows his sardonic countenance to
betray his inner thoughts, and will grasp the hand of
his most hated enemy with the hearty warmth of
friendship, a Satanic <i>volte-face</i> in which danger and
evil lurk always, a trait inherited to its full degree
by the Crown-Prince.</p>

<p>The days that followed Frau Kleist's midnight
visit were indeed busy, eventful days. Certain
diplomatic negotiations with Washington had been
unsuccessful; Von Holleben, the Ambassador, had
been recalled, and given an extremely bad half-hour
by both Kaiser and Chancellor. In addition, some
wily American journalist had fathomed the amazing
duplicity of Prince Henry's visit to the States and
Germany's Press Bureau in America, while the Yellow
Press of New York had published a ghastly array of
facts and figures concerning the latter, together with
facsimile documents, all of which had sent His
Majesty half-crazy with anger.</p>

<p>Nearly three months passed.</p>

<p>Herr Reitschel often came from Constantinople,
and frequently brought his handsome young wife
with him, for he was <i>persona grata</i> at Court. To
me this was indeed strange in view of the reports
of the ex-opera dancer's son&mdash;who, by the way, lived
in Constantinople in the unsuspicious guise of a
carpet-dealer, and unknown to the bank director.</p>

<p>The latter had, assisted by his wife's fortune,
inherited from her grandmother, purchased the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
Schloss Langenberg, the splendid ancestral castle
and estates of the Princes of Langenberg, situate on
a rock between Ilmenau and Zella, in the beautiful
Thuringian Forest, and acknowledged to be one of
the most famous shooting estates in the Empire. It
was not, therefore, surprising that the Emperor, to
mark his favour, should express a desire to shoot
capercailzie there&mdash;a desire which, of course, delighted
Herr Reitschel, who had only a few days before been
decorated with the Order of the Black Eagle.</p>

<p>One afternoon in mid-autumn the Emperor, accompanied
by the Crown-Prince and myself, together
with the suite, arrived by the Imperial train at the
little station of Ilmenau, where, of course, Reitschel
and his pretty wife, with the land-rats, head and
under foresters, and all sorts of civil officials in black
coats and white ties bowed low as the All-Highest
stepped from his saloon. The Kaiser was most
gracious to his host and hostess, while the schloss,
we found, was almost equal in beauty and extent to
that of Prince Max Egon zu F√ºrstenberg at Donau-Eschingen,
which place we always visited once, if not
twice, each year.</p>

<p>The Emperor had complained of a slight cold, and
in consequence, just before we left Berlin, I had been
instructed to summon by telegraph a certain Dr.
Vollerthun from Augsburg, who was a perfect
stranger to us all, but who had, I supposed, been
recommended to the Emperor by somebody who,
for some consideration, wished to advance him in
his profession.</p>

<p>While the Emperor and his host were out shooting,
the Crown-Prince and several of the suite being of
the party, I remained alone in a big, circular, old-world
room in one of the towers of the Castle, where
the long, narrow windows overlooked the forest,
dealing with a flood of important State papers which
a courier had brought from Berlin two hours before.
Papers followed us daily wherever we might be,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
even when yachting at Cowes or in the Norwegian
fjords.</p>

<p>About midday Dr. Vollerthun was ushered in to
me&mdash;a short, stout, guttural-speaking man of about
sixty, rather bald, and wearing big, round, gold-rimmed
spectacles. I quickly handed him over to
the major-domo. He was a stranger, and no doubt
one who sought the Emperor's favour, therefore
as such I took but little interest in him.</p>

<p>About three o'clock that same afternoon, however,
a light tap came at the door, and on looking round,
I saw my hostess standing upon the threshold.</p>

<p>She was quietly but elegantly dressed, presenting
the true type of the smart Parisienne, but in an
instant I realized that she was very pale and agitated.
Indeed her voice trembled when she asked permission
to enter.</p>

<p>Since her marriage I had many times chatted with
her, for she often came to the Palace when her
husband visited Berlin, as he did so frequently. I
had danced with her; I had taken her in to dinner
at various houses where we met, always finding her
a bright and very intellectual companion.</p>

<p>She quietly closed the door, and, crossing the room
with uneven steps, advanced to the table from which
I had risen.</p>

<p>"Count von Heltzendorff!" she exclaimed in a
low, strained voice. "I&mdash;I have come to seek your
aid because&mdash;well, because I'm distracted, and I
know that you are my husband's friend," she
exclaimed in French.</p>

<p>"And yours also, Madame," I said earnestly, bowing
and pulling forward a chair for her.</p>

<p>"My husband is out with the Emperor!" she
gasped in a curious, unnerved tone. "And I fear;
oh, I fear that we are in great peril&mdash;deadly peril
every hour&mdash;every moment!"</p>

<p>"Really, Madame, I hardly follow you," I said,
standing before the dark-haired, handsome French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
girl&mdash;for she was little more than a girl&mdash;who had inherited
the whole fortune of the biggest sugar refinery
in Europe, the great factory out at St. Denis which supplied
nearly one-sixth of the refined sugar of the world.</p>

<p>"My husband, whom I love devotedly, has done
his best in the interests of his Emperor. You,
Count, know&mdash;for you are in a position to know&mdash;the
real aims of the Kaiser in Turkey. These last six
months I have watched, and have learned the truth!
I know how, when the Emperor went to Constantinople
five months ago in pretence of friendship
towards the Sultan, with Professor Vamb√©ry as interpreter,
he practically compelled Abdul Hamid to
give him, in return for certain financial advances,
those wonderful jewels which the Empress Catherine,
wife of Peter the Great, gave in secret to the Grand
Vizier to secure the escape of the Russian Army
across the Pruth. I know how the Emperor seized
those wonderful emeralds, and, carrying them back to
Potsdam, has given them to the Empress. I know,
too, how he laughed with my husband at the cleverness
by which he is fooling the too trustful Turks. I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pardon, Madame," I said, interrupting her, and
speaking in French, "but is it really wise to speak
thus of the Emperor's secrets? Your husband is, I
fear, guilty of great indiscretion in mentioning such
matters."</p>

<p>"I am his wife, Count, and he conceals little, if
anything, from me."</p>

<p>I looked the pretty young woman straight in the
face in fear and regret.</p>

<p>Possession of those ancient jewels which, with
reluctance, Abdul Hamid had brought out from his
treasury, was one of the Kaiser's greatest secrets, a
secret of Potsdam known to no more than three
people, including myself. The Emperor had specially
imposed silence upon me, because he did not wish
the Powers to suspect his true Eastern policy of
bribery and double-dealing, blackmail and plunder.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>And yet she, the daughter of a French diplomat,
knew the truth!</p>

<p>Instantly I realized the serious danger of the
secret being betrayed to France.</p>

<p>"Madame," I said, leaning against the writing-table
as I spoke in deepest earnestness. "If I may
be permitted, I would urge that the Emperor's diplomacy
neither concerns your husband, as an official,
nor yourself. It is his own private affair, and should
neither be discussed nor betrayed."</p>

<p>"I know," she said. "That is just why I have
ventured to come here to consult you, M'sieur! You
have been my good friend as well as my husband's,
and here to-day, while the Emperor is our guest
beneath our roof, I feel that I am in greatest peril!"</p>

<p>"Why?" I asked with considerable surprise.</p>

<p>"The Emperor has already learnt that I know the
truth regarding his secret," was her slow reply.
"By what means His Majesty has discovered it, I,
alas! know not. But I do know from a confidential
quarter that I have incurred the Emperor's gravest
displeasure and hatred."</p>

<p>"Who is your informant?" I inquired sternly,
eager to further investigate the great intrigue.</p>

<p>"A certain person who must be nameless."</p>

<p>"Have you spoken to anybody of the Emperor's
secret plans in Turkey, or of his possession of the
Empress Catherine's jewels?"</p>

<p>"I have not uttered a word to a single soul except
my husband. I swear it."</p>

<p>"Your husband was extremely indiscreet in revealing
anything," I declared again quite frankly.</p>

<p>"I fully admit that. But what can I do? How
shall I act?" she asked in a low, tense voice.
"Advise me, do."</p>

<p>For some moments I remained silent. The situation,
with a pretty woman seeking my aid in such
circumstances, was difficult.</p>

<p>"Well, Madame," I replied after reflection, "if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
you are really ready to promise the strictest secrecy
and leave the matter to me, I will endeavour to find
a way out of the difficulty&mdash;providing you&mdash;good
German that you are by marriage&mdash;will take, before
the Emperor himself, an oath of complete secrecy?"</p>

<p>"I am ready to do anything&mdash;anything for my
dear husband's sake," the handsome young woman
assured me, tears welling in her fine dark eyes.</p>

<p>"In that case, then, please leave the matter entirely
in my hands," I said. And later on she left.</p>

<p>That same night, about ten o'clock, the Emperor,
in the dark-green uniform which he always wears at
dinner after hunting or shooting, entered the room to
which I had just returned to work.</p>

<p>"Send Frau Kleist to me," he snapped. "And I
will summon you later when I want you, Heltzendorff."</p>

<p>Frau Kleist! I had no idea the woman had
arrived at the castle. But I dispatched one of the
servants to search for her, and afterwards heard her
high-pitched voice as she ascended the stairs to hold
secret and, no doubt, evil counsel with His Majesty.</p>

<p>Below I found the fat, fair-haired little doctor
from Augsburg, who was still an enigma, but eager
to see his Imperial patient, and with him I smoked a
cigarette to while away the time. I was anxious to
return to His Majesty, and, as became my duty as
his adjutant, to explain what I had learnt from the
lips of our French hostess.</p>

<p>Suddenly one of the Imperial flunkeys bowed at
the door, commanding the doctor to the Royal
presence, and he left me, hot and flurried, as all
become who are unused to the Court atmosphere, its
rigid etiquette, and its constant bows.</p>

<p>Had the Emperor called the unknown doctor into
consultation with Frau Kleist?</p>

<p>Inquiries I had made concerning the doctor from
Augsburg showed that he was quite a well-known
specialist on mental diseases, and he had also written
a text-book upon bacteriology and the brain. Why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
had the Kaiser summoned him? He required no
brain specialist.</p>

<p>"We leave to-morrow at noon," the Emperor
exclaimed brusquely when, an hour later, I was
summoned to his room. This amazed me, for our
arrangements were to remain three days longer. I
recollected Madame Reitschel's words.</p>

<p>"I do not feel at all well," His Majesty added,
"and this Dr. Vollerthun orders me rest at Potsdam."</p>

<p>In silence I bowed, and then ventured to refer to
what was uppermost in my mind.</p>

<p>"May I be permitted to speak to your Majesty
upon a certain confidential subject?" I begged,
standing against the table whereat I had been writing
the greater part of that day.</p>

<p>"What subject?" snapped the All-Highest.</p>

<p>"Your Majesty's negotiations with the Sultan of
Turkey. Frau Reitschel has learnt of them, but
she is eager to come before you and take oath of
entire secrecy."</p>

<p>The Kaiser's eyes narrowed and glowed in sudden
anger.</p>

<p>"A woman's oath!" he cried. "Bah! Never
have I believed in silence imposed upon any woman's
tongue&mdash;more especially that of a born enemy! I
appreciate your loyalty and acumen, Von Heltzendorff,
but I have, fortunately, known this for some
little time, and in strictest secrecy have taken certain
measures to combat it. Remember that these words
have never been uttered to you! Remember that!
You are adjutant, and I am Emperor. Understand!
I fully appreciate and note your loyal report, but it
is not woman's sphere to enter our diplomacy, except
as a secret agent of our Fatherland. Let us say no
more."</p>

<p>Ten minutes later, being dismissed, I wandered
back through the great, silent, echoing corridors of
the ancient castle to my own room. A great human
drama, greater than any ever placed upon the stage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
was now being enacted. Throwing his loaded dice,
the Emperor, with all his craft, cunning, and criminal
unscrupulousness behind his mask of Christianity,
and aided by his unprincipled son, the Crown-Prince,
was actually plotting the downfall of the Turkish
Empire and the overthrow of Islam in Europe.
Between the All-Highest One and the realization of
those dastardly plans for world-power so carefully
and cleverly thought out in every detail night after
night in the silence of that dull, faded green room
upstairs at Potsdam, stood one frail little Parisienne,
the vivacious, well-meaning Madame Reitschel!</p>

<p>Next day we left the Schloss Langenberg, but
before doing so we heard with regret that our charming
little hostess had been suddenly taken ill during
the night, and the Kaiser, as a mark of favour, had
ordered his doctor, Vollerthun, to remain behind to
attend her. That Herr Reitschel was in great distress
I saw from his face as he stood taking leave of his
Imperial guest on the little platform at Ilmenau.</p>

<p>Back in Berlin, I wondered what was in progress
in that far-off Schloss in Thuringia, but a week later
the truth became vividly apparent when I read in
the <i>Staats-Anzeiger</i> an announcement which disclosed
to me the terrible truth.</p>

<p>I held my breath as my eyes followed the printed
lines.</p>

<p>Frau Reitschel, the young wife of the famous
Anton Reitschel of Constantinople, had, the journal
reported, been seized by a sudden and somewhat
mysterious illness on the night prior to the Emperor's
departure from the Schloss Langenberg, and though
His Majesty had graciously left his own physician
behind to attend her, the unfortunate lady had
developed insanity to such a hopeless degree that it
had been necessary to confine her in the Rosenau
private asylum at Coburg.</p>

<p>In a second I realized how the dancing-mistress
and the mental specialist from Augsburg had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
the tools of the Emperor. That "mysterious illness,"
developing into madness, was surely not the
result of any natural cause, but had been deliberately
planned and executed by means of a hypodermic
syringe, in order that the woman who had learnt the
secret of the Emperor's double cunning in the Near
East should be for ever immured in a madhouse.</p>

<p>Outside the trio responsible for the cruel and
dastardly act, I alone knew the truth how, by the
Emperor's drastic action, he had prevented the
secret of his chicanery leaking out to the Powers.</p>

<p>Poor Madame Reitschel! She died early in 1913,
a raving lunatic. Her devoted husband, having
served the Emperor's purpose, had been recalled to
Berlin, where, bereft of the Kaiser's favour, he predeceased
her by about six months, broken-hearted,
but in utter ignorance of that foul plot carried out
under his very nose and in his own castle.</p>

<h2><a name="SECRET_NUMBER_FIVE" id="SECRET_NUMBER_FIVE"></a>SECRET NUMBER FIVE</h2>
<h3>THE GIRL WHO KNEW THE CROWN-PRINCE'S SECRET</h3>


<p>Late on the night of November 18th, 1912, I
was busily at work in the Crown-Prince's
room&mdash;that cosy apartment of which I possessed the
key&mdash;at the Marble Palace at Potsdam.</p>

<p>I, as His Imperial Highness's personal-adjutant, had
been travelling all day with him from Cologne to
Berlin. We had done a tour of military inspections
in Westphalia, and, as usual, "Willie's" conduct, as
became the heir-apparent of the psalm-singing All-Highest
One, had not been exactly exemplary.</p>

<p>With his slant eyes and sarcastic grin he openly
defied the Emperor, and frequently referred to him to
his intimates as "a hoary old hypocrite"&mdash;the truth
of which recent events have surely proved.</p>

<p>On the night in question, however, much had
happened. The Emperor had, a month before,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
returned from a visit to England, where he had been
engaged by speeches and hand-shakes, public and
private, blowing a narcotic dust into the nostrils of
your dear but, alas! too confiding nation.</p>

<p>You British were all dazzled&mdash;you dear English
drank the Imperial sleeping-draught, prepared so
cunningly for you and your Cabinet Ministers in what
we in Berlin sometimes called "the Downing-Strasse."
You lapped up the cream of German good-fellowship
as a cat laps milk, even while agents of our Imperial
War Staff had held Staff-rides in various parts of your
island. All of you were blind, save those whom your
own people denounced as scaremongers when they
lifted their voices in warning.</p>

<p>We at Potsdam smiled daily at what seemed to us
to be the slow but sure decline of your great nation
from its military, naval, and commercial supremacy.
The Kaiser had plotted for fourteen years, and now
he was being actively aided by his eldest son, that
shrewd, active agnostic with a criminal kink.</p>

<p>"Heltzendorff!" exclaimed the Crown-Prince, as he
suddenly entered the room where I was busy attending
to a pile of papers which had accumulated during
our absence in Westphalia, and which had been
sorted into three heaps by my assistant during our
absence. "Do get through all those letters and
things. Burn them all if you can. What do they
matter?"</p>

<p>"Many of them are matters of grave importance.
Here, for instance, is a report from the Chief of
Military Intelligence in Washington."</p>

<p>"Oh, old Friesch! Tear it up! He is but an old
fossil at best. And yet, Heltzendorff, he is designed
to be of considerable use," he added. "His Majesty
told me to-night that after his visit to England he
has conceived the idea to establish an official movement
for the improvement of better relations between
Britain and Germany. The dear British are always
ready to receive such movements with open arms.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
At Carlton House Terrace they strongly endorse the
Emperor's ideas, and he tells me that the movement
should first arise in commercial and shipping circles.
Herr Ballin will generate the idea in his offices in
London and the various British ports, while His
Majesty has Von Gessler, the ex-Ambassador at
Washington, in view as the man to bring forth the
suggestion publicly. Indeed, to-night from the
Wilhelmstrasse there has been sent a message to his
schloss on the Mosel commanding him to consult with
His Majesty. Von Bernstorff took his place at
Washington a few months ago."</p>

<p>"But Von Gessler is an inveterate enemy of
Britain," I exclaimed in surprise, still seated at my
table.</p>

<p>"The world does not know that. The whole
scheme is based upon Britain's ignorance of our intentions.
We bring Von Gessler forward as the dear,
good, Anglophile friend with his hand outstretched
from the Wilhelmstrasse. Oh, Heltzendorff!" he
laughed. "It is really intensely amusing, is it not?"</p>

<p>I was silent. I knew that the deeply-laid plot
against Great Britain was proceeding apace, for had I
not seen those many secret reports, and did I not
possess inside knowledge of the evil intentions of the
Emperor and his son.</p>

<p>"Get through all that&mdash;to-night if you can,
Heltzendorff," the Crown-Prince urged. "The
Crown-Princess leaves for Treseburg, in the Harz,
to-morrow, and in the evening we go to Nice."</p>

<p>"To Nice!" I exclaimed, though not at all disinclined
to spend a week or so on the Riviera.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said. "I have a friend there. The
Riviera is only pleasant before the season, or after.
One cannot go with the crowd in January or February.
I have already given orders for the saloon to leave at
eleven to-morrow night. That will give us ample
time."</p>

<p>A friend there! I reflected. I, knowing his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
partiality to the eternal petticoat, could only suppose
that the attraction in Nice was of the feminine gender.</p>

<p>"Then the lady is in Nice!" I remarked, for sometimes
I was permitted, on account of my long service
with the Emperor, to speak familiarly.</p>

<p>"Lady, no!" he retorted. "It is a man. And I
want to get to Nice at the earliest moment. So get
through those infernal documents. Burn them all.
They are better out of the way," he laughed.</p>

<p>And, taking a cigarette from the golden box&mdash;a
present to him from "Tino" of Greece&mdash;he lit it,
and wishing me good night, strode out.</p>

<p>Just before eleven o'clock on the following night
we left the Marmor Palace. His Imperial Highness
travelled incognito as he always did when visiting
France, assuming the name of Count von Gr√ºnau.
With us was his personal valet, Schuler, the military
secretary, Major Lentze, and Eckardt, the Commissioner
of Secret Police for His Highness's personal
protection, who travelled with us wherever we went.
In addition, there was an under-valet, and Knof, the
Crown-Prince's favourite chauffeur. When abroad
cars were either bought and afterwards re-sold, or
else hired, but Knof, who was a celebrated racing
motorist and had driven in Prince Henry's tour of
exploration through England, and who had gained
many prizes on the various circuits, was always taken
as "driver."</p>

<p>After a restless night&mdash;for there were many stoppages&mdash;I
spent next day with the Crown-Prince in
long and tiring discussions on military affairs as we
travelled due south in the beautifully-fitted Imperial
car, replete with its smoking saloon with wicker
chairs, its four bathrooms, and other luxuries. I
endeavoured to obtain from him some reason why we
were proceeding to Nice, but to all my inquiries he
was smilingly dumb. He noticed my eagerness,
and I saw that he was amused by it.</p>

<p>Yet somehow, as we travelled towards the Italian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
frontier&mdash;for our road lay through Austria down to
Milan, and thence by way of Genoa&mdash;he seemed to
become unduly thoughtful and anxious.</p>

<p>Only a fortnight before he had had one of those
ever-recurring and unseemly quarrels with his long-suffering
wife.</p>

<p>"Cilli is a fool!" he had declared openly to me,
after she had left the room in anger.</p>

<p>We had been busy arranging a programme of
official visits in Eastern Germany, when suddenly the
Crown-Princess entered, pale with anger, and disregarding
my presence&mdash;for I suppose I was regarded
as one who knew all the happenings of the palace,
and whose discretion could be relied upon&mdash;began
to demand fiercely an explanation of a certain anonymous
letter which she held in her hand.</p>

<p>"Kindly read that!" she said haughtily, "and
explain what it means!"</p>

<p>The Crown-Prince grinned idiotically, that cold,
sinister expression overspreading his countenance, a
look which is such a marked characteristic of his.</p>

<p>Then, almost snatching the letter from his young
wife's fingers, he read it through, and with a sudden
movement tore it up and flung it upon the carpet,
saying:</p>

<p>"I refuse to discuss any unsigned letter! Really, if
we were to notice every letter written by the common
scum we should, indeed, have sufficient to do."</p>

<p>His wife's arched brows narrowed. Her pale,
delicate face, in which the lines of care had appeared
too prematurely, already betrayed fiercest anger.</p>

<p>"I happen to have inquired, and I now know that
those allegations are correct!" she cried. "This
dark-haired singer-woman, Irene Speroni, has attained
great success on the variety stage in Italy. She is the
star of the Sala Margherita in Rome."</p>

<p>"Well?" he asked in defiance. "And what of
it, pray?"</p>

<p>"That letter you have destroyed tells me the truth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
I received it a few days ago, and sent an agent to
Italy in order to learn the truth. He has returned
to-night. See!" And suddenly she produced a
crannied snapshot photograph, of postcard size, of
the Crown-Prince in his polo-playing garb, and with
him a smartly-dressed young woman, whose features
were in the shadow. I caught sight of that picture,
because when he tossed it from him angrily without
glancing at it, I picked it up and handed it back to
the Crown-Princess.</p>

<p>"Yes," she cried bitterly, "You refuse, of course,
to look upon this piece of evidence! I now know why
you went to Wiesbaden. The woman was singing
there, and you gave her a pair of emerald and diamond
earrings which you purchased from Vollgold in Unter
den Linden. See! Here is the bill for them!"</p>

<p>And again she produced a slip of paper.</p>

<p>At this the Crown-Prince grew instantly furious,
and, pale to the lips, he roundly abused his long-suffering
wife, telling her quite frankly that, notwithstanding
the fact that she might spy upon his movements,
he should act exactly as his impulses dictated.</p>

<p>That scene was, indeed, a disgraceful one, ending
in the poor woman, in a frantic paroxysm of despair,
tearing off the splendid necklet of diamonds at her
throat&mdash;his present to her on their marriage&mdash;and
casting it full into his face.</p>

<p>Then, realizing that the scene had become too
tragic, I took her small hand, and, with a word of
sympathy, led her out of the room and along the
corridor.</p>

<p>As I left her she burst into a sudden torrent of
tears; yet when I returned again to the Crown-Prince
I found his manner had entirely changed. He treated
his wife's natural resentment and indignation as a
huge joke, and it was then that His Imperial Highness
declared to me:</p>

<p>"Cilli is a fool!"</p>

<p>That sunny afternoon the Crown-Prince had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
sprawled himself on the plush lounge of the smoking
car as the train travelled upon that picturesque line
between Genoa and the French frontier at Ventimiglia,
the line which follows the coast for six hours.
With the tideless sapphire Mediterranean lapping the
yellow beach on the one side and high brown rocks
upon the other, we went through Savona, Albenga,
the old-world Porto Maurizio to the glaring modern
town of San Remo and palm-embowered Bordighera,
that beautiful Italian Riviera that you and I know
so well.</p>

<p>"Listen, Heltzendorff," his Highness exclaimed
suddenly between the whiffs of his cigarette. "In
Nice I may disappear for a day or two. I may be
missing. But if I am, please don't raise a fuss about
it. I'm incognito, and nobody will know. I may
be absent for seven days. If I am not back by that
time then you may make inquiry."</p>

<p>"But the Commissary of Police Eckardt! He
will surely know?" I remarked in surprise.</p>

<p>"No. He won't know. I shall evade him as I've
so often done before," replied His Imperial Highness.
"I tell you of my intentions so that you may curb
the activities of our most estimable friend. Tell
him not to worry, and he will be paid a thousand
marks on the day Count von Gr√ºnau reappears."</p>

<p>I smiled, for I saw the influence of the eternal
feminine.</p>

<p>"No, Heltzendorff. You are quite mistaken," he
said, reading my thoughts, and putting down his
cigarette end. "There is no lady in this case. I
am out here for secret purposes of my own. For that
reason I take you into my confidence rather than
that unnecessary inquiry should be made and some of
those infernal journalists get hold of the fact that the
Count von Gr√ºnau and the Crown-Prince are one and
the same person. I was a fool to take this saloon.
I ought to have travelled as an ordinary passenger,
I know, but," he laughed, "this is really comfortable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
and, after all, what do we care what the world thinks&mdash;eh?
Surely we can afford to laugh at it when all
the honours of the game are already in our hands."</p>

<p>And at that moment we ran into the pretty,
flower-decked station of San Remo, the place freshly
painted for the attraction of the winter visitors who
annually went south for sunshine.</p>

<p>His words mystified me, but I became even more
mystified by his actions a few days later.</p>

<p>I was in ignorance that a fortnight before Hermann
Hardt, one of His Highness's couriers, had left
Potsdam and on arrival at Nice had rented for three
months the fine Villa Lilas&mdash;the winter residence of
the American millionaire leather merchant, James G.
Jamieson, of Boston, who had gone yachting to Japan.</p>

<p>You know Nice, my dear Le Queux&mdash;you know it
as well as I do, therefore you know the Villa Lilas,
that big white mansion which faces the sea on Montboron,
the hill road between the port of Nice and
Villefranche. Half hidden among the mimosa, the
palms, and grey-green olives, it is after the style of
Mr. Gordon Bennett's villa at Beaulieu, with a big
glass front and pretty verandas, with climbing
geraniums flowering upon the terraces.</p>

<p>We soon settled there, for the household staff had
arrived three days before, and on the evening of our
arrival I accompanied the Crown-Prince down into
the town to the Jet√©e promenade, the pier-pavilion
where the gay cosmopolitan world disports itself to
chatter, drink and gamble.</p>

<p>It was a glorious moonlit night, and "Willie,"
after strolling through the great gilded saloons, in
one of which was a second-rate variety entertainment&mdash;the
season not having yet commenced&mdash;went outside.
We sat at the end of the pier smoking.</p>

<p>"Nice is dull as yet, is it not?" he remarked, for
each year he always spent a month there incognito,
the German newspapers announcing that he was
away shooting. But "Willie," leading the gay life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
of the Imperial butterfly, much preferred the lively
existence of the C√¥te d'Azur to the remote schloss in
Thuringia or elsewhere.</p>

<p>I agreed with him that Nice had not yet put on
the tinsel and pasteboard of her Carnival attractions.
As you know, Carnival in Nice is gay enough, but,
after all, it is a forced gaiety got up for the profit of
the shops and hotels, combined with the "Cercle des
Bains" of Monaco&mdash;the polite title of the Prince's
gilded gambling hell.</p>

<p>We smoked together and chatted, as we often did
when His Imperial Highness became bored. I was
still mystified why we had come to the Riviera so
early in the season, because the white and pale green
paint of the hotels was not yet dry, and half of them
not yet open.</p>

<p>Yet our coming had, no doubt, been privately signalled,
because within half an hour of our arrival at
the Villa Lilas a short, stout old Frenchman, with
white, bristly hair&mdash;whom I afterwards found out was
Monsieur Paul Bavouzet, the newly-appointed Prefect
of the Department of Alpes-Maritimes&mdash;called
to leave his card upon the Count von Gr√ºnau.</p>

<p>The Imperial incognito only means that the public
are to be deluded. Officialdom never is. They know
the ruse, and support it all the world over. His
Highness the Crown-Prince was paying his annual
visit to Nice, and the President had sent his compliments
through his representative, the bristly-haired
little Prefect.</p>

<p>Soon after eleven that night the Crown-Prince,
after chatting affably with me, strolled back to the
Promenade des Anglais, where Knof, the chauffeur,
awaited us with a big open car, in which we were
whizzed around the port and up to Montboron in a
few minutes.</p>

<p>As I parted from the Crown-Prince, who yawned
and declared that he was tired, he said:</p>

<p>"Ah! Heltzendorff. How good it is to get a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
breath of soft air from the Mediterranean! We
shall have a port on this pleasant sea one day&mdash;if we
live as long&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>That remark showed the trend of events. It
showed how, hand in hand with the Emperor, he
was urging preparations for war&mdash;a war that had for
its primary object the destruction of the Powers
which, when the volcano erupted, united as allies.</p>

<p>The bright autumn days passed quite uneventfully,
and frequently I went pleasant motor runs into the
mountains with His Highness, up to the frontier at
the Col di Tenda, to La V√©subie, Puget-Th√©niers,
and other places. Yet I was still mystified at the
reason of our sojourn there.</p>

<p>After we had been at the Villa Lilas about ten
days I was one afternoon seated outside the popular
Caf√© de l'Op√©ra, in the Place Mass√©na, when a lady,
dressed in deep mourning and wearing the heavy veil
in French style, passed along the pavement, glanced
at me, and then, hesitating, she turned, and, coming
back, advanced to the little table in the corner
whereat I was sitting.</p>

<p>"May I be permitted to have a word with you,
Monsieur?" she asked in French, in a low, refined
voice.</p>

<p>"Certainly," was my reply, and, not without some
surprise, I rose and drew a chair for her.</p>

<p>She glanced round quickly, as though to satisfy
herself that she would not be overheard, but, as a
matter of fact, at that hour the chairs on the terraces
of the caf√© were practically deserted. At the same
moment, viewing her closely, I saw that she was about
twenty-four, handsome, dark-haired, with well-cut
features.</p>

<p>"I know, Monsieur, that I am a complete stranger
to you," she exclaimed with a smile, "but to me you
are quite familiar by sight. I have passed you many
times in Berlin and in Potsdam, and I know that you
are Count von Heltzendorff, personal-adjutant to His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
Highness the Crown-Prince&mdash;or Count von Gr√ºnau,
as he is known here in France."</p>

<p>"You know that!" I exclaimed.</p>

<p>She smiled mysteriously, replying:</p>

<p>"Yes. I&mdash;well, I happen to be a friend of His
Highness."</p>

<p>I held my breath. So this pretty young Frenchwoman
was one of my young Imperial master's
friends!</p>

<p>"The fact is, Count," she went on, "I have
travelled a considerable distance to see you. I said
that I was one of the Crown-Prince's friends. Please
do not misunderstand me. I know that he has a
good many lady friends, but, as far as I am concerned,
I have never been introduced to him, and he does
not know me. I am his friend because of a certain
friendliness towards him."</p>

<p>"Really, Madame, I don't quite understand,"
I said.</p>

<p>"Of course not," she answered, and then, glancing
round, she added: "This place is a little too public.
Cannot we go across to the garden yonder?"</p>

<p>At her suggestion I rose and walked with her to a
quiet spot in the gardens, where we sat down, and
I listened with interest to her.</p>

<p>She told me that her name was Julie de Rouville,
but she would give no account of where she lived,
though I took it that she was a young widow.</p>

<p>"I have ventured to approach you, Count, because
I cannot approach the Crown-Prince," she said presently.
"You probably do not know the true reason
of his visit here to Nice?"</p>

<p>"No," I said. "I admit that I do not. Why is
he here?"</p>

<p>"It is a secret of his own. But, curiously enough,
I am aware of the reason, and that is why I have
sought you. Would it surprise you if I told you that
in a certain quarter in France it will, in a few days,
be known that the German Emperor is establishing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
a movement for an <i>entente</i> between Germany and
Britain, and that the whole affair is based upon a
fraud? The Emperor wants no <i>entente</i>, but only
war with France and with Britain. The whole plot
will be exposed in a few days!"</p>

<p>"From what source have you derived this knowledge?"
I asked, looking at her in amazement that
she should know one of the greatest State secrets of
Germany.</p>

<p>But she again smiled mysteriously, and said:</p>

<p>"I merely tell you this in order to prove to you
that I am in possession of certain facts known to
but few people."</p>

<p>"You evidently are," I said. "But who intends
to betray the truth to France?"</p>

<p>"I regret, Count, that I cannot answer your
question."</p>

<p>"If you are, as you say, the Crown-Prince's friend,
it would surely be a friendly act to let us know the
truth, so that steps may be taken, perhaps, to avoid
the secret of Germany's diplomacy from leaking out
to her enemies."</p>

<p>"All I can tell you, Count, is that the matter is
one of gravest importance."</p>

<p>"But will you not speak openly, and give us the
actual facts?"</p>

<p>"I will&mdash;but to His Imperial Highness alone," was
her answer.</p>

<p>"You wish to meet him, then?" I asked, rather
suspicious that it might after all be only a woman's
ruse. And yet what she had said showed that she
knew the Emperor's secret, for she had actually mentioned
Von Gessler's name in connection with the
pretended Anglo-German <i>entente</i>.</p>

<p>"If His Highness will honour me with an interview,
then I will reveal all I know, and, further, will suggest
a means of preventing the truth from leaking out."</p>

<p>"But you are French," I said.</p>

<p>"I have told you so," she laughed. "But probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
His Highness will refuse to see Julie de Rouville,
therefore I think it best if you show him this."</p>

<p>From her little gold chain-purse she produced a
small, unmounted photograph of herself, and handed
it to me.</p>

<p>"When he recognizes who wishes to see him he will
fully understand," she said, in a quiet, refined voice.
"A letter addressed to Julie de Rouville at the Post
Restante at Marseilles will quickly find me."</p>

<p>"At Marseilles?" I echoed.</p>

<p>"Yes. I do not wish the letter to be sent to me
here. From Marseilles I shall duly receive it."</p>

<p>I was silent for a few moments.</p>

<p>"I confess," I exclaimed at last. "I confess I
do not exactly see the necessity for an interview
with His Highness, when whatever you tell me&mdash;as
his personal-adjutant&mdash;will be regarded as strictly
in confidence."</p>

<p>Truth to tell, I was extremely suspicious of her.
She might be desirous of meeting the Prince with
some evil intent.</p>

<p>"I have already said, Count Heltzendorff, that I
am His Highness's friend, and wish to approach him
with motives of friendship."</p>

<p>"You wish for no payment for this information,
eh?" I asked suspiciously, half believing that she
might be a secret agent of France.</p>

<p>"Payment&mdash;of course not!" she answered, half
indignantly. "Show that photograph to the Crown-Prince,
and tell him that I apply for an interview."</p>

<p>Then, rather abruptly, she rose, and, thanking me,
wished me good afternoon, and walked away, leaving
me with her photograph in my hand.</p>

<p>The Crown-Prince was out motoring, and did not
get back to the Villa until after seven o'clock.</p>

<p>As soon as I heard of his return I went to his room,
and recounted my strange adventure with the dark-haired
young woman in black. He became keenly
interested, and the more so when I told him of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
secret knowledge of the Kaiser's intended establishment
of a bogus <i>entente</i> with Great Britain.</p>

<p>"She wishes to see you," I said. "And she told
me to give you her photograph."</p>

<p>I handed it to him.</p>

<p>At sight of it his face instantly changed. He held
his breath, and then examined the photograph
beneath the light. Afterwards I noticed a strange,
hard look at the corners of his mouth, while his teeth
set themselves firmly.</p>

<p>Next second, however, he had recovered his self-possession,
and with a low laugh said:</p>

<p>"Yes. Of course, I know her. She wants me
to write to Julie de Rouville at the Post Restante at
Marseilles, eh? H'm&mdash;I'll think it over."</p>

<p>And I could see that sight of the photograph had
not only displeased him, but it also caused him very
considerable uneasiness.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon, two days later, His Highness,
who had been walking alone, and who had apparently
evaded the vigilance of the ever-watchful Eckardt,
returned to the Villa with a stranger, a tall, rather
thin, fair-haired man, undoubtedly a German, and
the pair were closeted together, holding counsel
evidently for a considerable time. Where His Highness
met him I knew not, but when later on I entered
the room I saw that the pair were on quite friendly
terms.</p>

<p>His Highness addressed him as Herr Sch√§fer, and
when he had left he told me that he was from the
Wilhelmstrasse, and had been attached to the Embassy
at Washington, and afterwards in London,
"for affairs of the Press"&mdash;which meant that he was
conductor of the German Press propaganda.</p>

<p>It seemed curious that the young man Sch√§fer
should be in such high favour with the Crown-Prince.</p>

<p>I watched closely. Whatever was in progress was
a strict secret between the pair. The more I saw of
Hans Sch√§fer the more I disliked him. He had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
cruel eyes and heavy, sensuous lips&mdash;a coarse countenance
which was the reverse of prepossessing,
though I could see that he was a very clever and
cunning person.</p>

<p>For a full fortnight the Crown-Prince and the
man Sch√§fer were almost inseparable. Was it for
the purpose of meeting Sch√§fer that we had gone to
Nice? The man had been back from London about
two months, and had, I learnt, been lately living
in Paris.</p>

<p>One evening while strolling in the sunset by the
sea along the tree-lined Promenade des Anglais, I
suddenly encountered Julie de Rouville, dressed in
mourning, a quiet, pathetic figure, just as we had
last met.</p>

<p>I instantly recollected that since the evening when
I had given her photograph to the Crown-Prince he
had never mentioned her, and I could only believe
that for some mysterious reason sight of the picture
had recalled some distasteful memory.</p>

<p>"Ah, Count!" she cried, as I halted and raised
my hat. "This is, indeed, a welcome meeting! I
have been looking out for you for the past two days."</p>

<p>"I've been staying over at Cannes," was my
reply. "Well?"</p>

<p>She indicated a seat, and upon it we sat together.</p>

<p>"I have to thank you for giving my photograph
and message to His Highness," she said in that sweet,
refined voice that I so well remembered.</p>

<p>"I trust that the Crown-Prince has written to
you&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>She smiled, a trifle sadly I thought.</p>

<p>"Well, no&mdash;&mdash;" was her rather vague reply.</p>

<p>"Then how are you aware that I gave your
message?"</p>

<p>She shook her head and again smiled.</p>

<p>"I had my own means of discovery. By certain
signs I knew that you had carried out your promise,"
she said. "But as I have heard nothing, I wish you,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
if you will, to deliver another message&mdash;a very urgent
one. Tell him I must see him, for I dread daily lest
the truth of the Kaiser's real intentions be known at
the Quai d'Orsay."</p>

<p>"Certainly," was my polite reply. "I will deliver
your message this evening."</p>

<p>"Tell him that my sole desire is to act in the
interests of the Emperor and himself," she urged.</p>

<p>"But, forgive me," I said, "I cannot see why you
should interest yourself in the Crown-Prince if he
declines to communicate with you."</p>

<p>"I have my reasons, Count von Heltzendorff," was
her rather haughty reply. "Please tell him that the
matter will not brook further delay."</p>

<p>I had seen in the London newspapers during the
past week how eagerly the English journalists, with
the dust cast into their eyes, were blindly advocating
that the British public should welcome the great
German national movement, headed by Baron von
Gessler, supported by Ballin, Delbr√ºck, and Von
Wedel, with the hearty co-operation of the Emperor
and the Imperial Chancellor&mdash;the movement to
establish better relations with Great Britain.</p>

<p>I knew that the secret should at all hazards be kept,
and that night I told the Crown-Prince of my second
meeting with the pretty woman in black and her
urgent request.</p>

<p>He laughed, but made no remark. Yet I knew by
his tone that he was not so easy in his mind as he
desired me to believe.</p>

<p>It also seemed strange why, if the young Frenchwoman
was so desirous of meeting him, she did not
call at the Villa.</p>

<p>About a week later it suddenly occurred to me to
endeavour to discover the real identity of the lady in
black, but as I was not certain whether she actually
lived in Nice it was rather difficult. Nevertheless,
by invoking the aid of my friend Belabre, inspector
of the S√ªret√© of Nice, and after waiting a few days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
I made an astounding discovery, namely, that the
lady who called herself De Rouville was an Italian
caf√© concert singer named Irene Speroni&mdash;the woman
who had aroused the jealousy of the Crown-Princess!
And she knew that important State secret of
Germany!</p>

<p>The situation was, I saw, a most serious one.
Indeed, I felt it my duty to mention my discovery to
His Highness, when, to my surprise, he was not in the
least angry. He merely said:</p>

<p>"It is true, Heltzendorff&mdash;true what the Crown-Princess
declared&mdash;that I went to Wiesbaden and
that I gave the woman a pair of emerald earrings
which I ordered from old Vollgold. But there was
no reason for jealousy. I saw the woman, and gave
her the present in the hope of closing her lips."</p>

<p>In a moment I understood. The pretty variety
artiste was endeavouring to levy blackmail. But
how could she, in her position, have learnt the secret
of the Emperor's intentions?</p>

<p>She was, I found, living as Signorina Speroni, with
her maid, at the H√¥tel Bristol over at Beaulieu, just
across the blue bay of Villefranche, and as the days
went on I realized the imminent danger of exposure,
and wondered if the Kaiser knew of it.</p>

<p>I made a remark to that effect to His Highness one
morning, whereupon he replied:</p>

<p>"Don't disturb yourself, my dear Heltzendorff!
I have not overlooked the matter, for it is one that
closely concerns both the Emperor and myself. The
woman obtained the secret by opening the dispatch-box
of one who believed her to be his friend, and then
she attempted to use her knowledge in order to drag
me into her net. But I do not think I am very likely
to be caught&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>At that moment Herr Sch√§fer entered the room,
therefore further discussion was out of the question.</p>

<p>From inquiries I made later on I found that the
concert singer had suddenly left the hotel, therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
I went over to Beaulieu and had an instructive chat
with the hall porter, a German of course. From him
I learnt that the Signorina had been staying there
ever since the date when we had arrived at Nice,
and, further, that two gentleman had been frequently
in the habit of calling upon her. One was a smart
young Frenchman who came in a motor-car, and the
other was a German. From the description of the
latter I at once came to the conclusion that it was
none other than Herr Sch√§fer!</p>

<p>"The one gentleman did not know of the other's
visits," said the bearded porter, with a laugh. "The
Signorina always impressed silence upon me, because
she thought one would be jealous of the other. The
German gentleman seemed very deeply in love with
her, and she called him Hans. He accompanied her
when she left here for San Remo."</p>

<p>I reported this to His Highness, but he made no
remark. That some devilish plot was being carried
out I suspected. The Hohenzollerns are ready to go
to any length to prevent their black secrets from
leaking out.</p>

<p>My surmise proved correct, for, a week later, some
fishermen found upon the brown rocks near Capo
Verde, beyond San Remo, the body of a woman,
fully dressed, afterwards identified as that of Irene
Speroni, the singer so popular in Rome.</p>

<p>It was proved that on the previous night she had
been seen by two peasants walking along the sea road
near San Lorenzo, accompanied by a tall, thin man,
who seemed greatly excited, and was talking in
German. It was believed by the Italian police that
the unknown German, in a fit of jealousy, threw her
into the sea.</p>

<p>From facts I gathered some months later I realized
that the whole plot had been most cunningly conceived
by the Crown-Prince. Sch√§fer, after his return
from America, had met the woman Speroni, who was
performing in London, and she had, unknown to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
him, opened his dispatch-box, and from some secret
correspondence had learned the real truth regarding
the proposed <i>entente</i> which the Emperor contemplated.</p>

<p>Sch√§fer, alarmed at the woman's knowledge, and
yet fascinated by her charms, had gone to the Crown-Prince,
and he, in turn, had seen the woman in Wiesbaden.
Finding her so dangerous to the Emperor's
plans, His Highness then conceived a fiendish plot.
He first introduced her to a young French Marquis,
de Vienne by name, who pestered her with his attentions,
and followed her to Beaulieu. Having so far
succeeded, the Crown-Prince went to Nice, and
cleverly played upon Sch√§fer's love for the woman,
pointing out that she was playing a double game, and
urging him to watch.</p>

<p>He did so, and discovered the truth. Then there
occurred the tragedy of jealousy, exactly as the police
believed.</p>

<p>Herr Sch√§fer, the tool of His Imperial Highness,
had, however, escaped to Germany, and the police
of San Remo are still in ignorance of his identity.</p>

<h2><a name="SECRET_NUMBER_SIX" id="SECRET_NUMBER_SIX"></a>SECRET NUMBER SIX</h2>
<h3>THE AFFAIR OF THE HUNCHBACKED COUNTESS</h3>


<p>I suppose that none of your British friends have
ever heard the name of Thyra Adelheid von
Kienitz.</p>

<p>She was a funny little deformed person, aged,
perhaps, seventy, widow of the great General von
Kienitz, who had served in the Franco-German
campaign, and who, before his death, had been
acknowledged to be as great a strategist as your own
Lord Roberts, whom every good German&mdash;I did not
write Prussian&mdash;salutes in reverence.</p>

<p>Countess von Kienitz was the daughter of a certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
Countess von Borcke, and after living for many
years in retirement in her picturesque old schloss
perched on a rock not far from the famous wine
district of Berncastel, on the winding Mosel river,
became suddenly seized with an idea to re-enter Berlin
society.</p>

<p>With this view she rented a fine house not far from
the Liechtenstein Bridge, and early in 1911 commenced
a series of wildly-extravagant entertainments&mdash;luncheons,
dinners, and supper concerts, at which
were artistes to whom three-thousand-mark fees were
often paid&mdash;with a view, as it seemed to me, to attract
the more modern and go-ahead section of Berlin
society.</p>

<p>At first the smarter set looked askance at the
ugly, deformed, painted-up old woman with the
squeaky voice, and they strenuously declined invitations
to her splendid, newly-furnished mansion in
the Stulerstrasse. Indeed, the name of the Countess
von Kienitz became synonymous for all that was
grotesque, and her painted, doll-like countenance and
yellow wig were the laughing-stock of both the upper
and middle classes.</p>

<p>Nevertheless she strenuously endeavoured to
surround herself with young society of both sexes,
and many smart dances were given at the Stulerstrasse
during the season&mdash;dances at which the swaggering
Prussian officer was seen at his gorgeous best.</p>

<p>One afternoon, seated by the Crown-Prince as he
drove recklessly his great Merc√©d√®s car along the
Bismarckallee in the direction of Potsdam, we passed
an overdressed old woman, very artificial, with yellow
hair, and short of stature.</p>

<p>"Look, Heltzendorff! Is she not like that old
crow, Von Kienitz?"</p>

<p>"Yes, her figure is very similar," I admitted.</p>

<p>"Ah! The old woman was introduced to me the
other night at Bismarck-Bohlen's house. <i>Himmel!</i>
What a freak! Have you seen her wig?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>I replied that I had visited once or twice at the
Stulerstrasse, and that the company I had met there
were certainly amusing. I mentioned some of their
names, among them that of young Von Ratibor,
Major Gersdorff, of the Death's Head Hussars, Von
Heynitz, of the K√∂nigsj√§ger, a well-known man about
town, his friend Winterfeld, together with a number
of ladies of the very ultra go-ahead set. At this His
Highness seemed highly interested.</p>

<p>"She certainly seems a very curious old person,"
he laughed. "Fancies that she's but twenty-five,
and actually had the audacity to dance at Bismarck-Bohlen's.
Somebody was cruel enough to ask her
to sing a French <i>chansonnette</i>!"</p>

<p>"Did she?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"Of course. She put herself into a martial attitude,
and sang something about 'Le drapeau' of 'Jacques
Bonhomme,' as though we wished to know anything
about it. The man who suggested the song was
sorry."</p>

<p>I laughed heartily. Sometimes the Crown-Prince
could be humorous, and it certainly must have been
distinctly quaint when, as a result of the joke played
upon the old Countess, she so completely turned the
tables upon the party by singing a song full of French
sentiment.</p>

<p>That circumstance told me that she must be a
very clever old lady, even though she wore that tow-coloured
wig which sometimes on nights of merriment
got a trifle askew.</p>

<p>Judge my great surprise, however, when, about
six weeks later, Frau von Alvensleben, the pretty
<i>Grande Ma√Ætresse</i> of the Court of the Crown-Princess,
stopped me in one of the corridors of the Marmor
Palace and, drawing me aside, whispered:</p>

<p>"I have news for you, my dear Count. We have a
new arrival at Court&mdash;Frau Yellow-Wig."</p>

<p>I looked at her, for the moment puzzled. She saw
that I did not follow her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>"Countess von Kienitz&mdash;a friend of yours, I
believe."</p>

<p>"Friend of mine!" I echoed. "I've only been to
her house three or four times, just in a crowd, and out
of curiosity."</p>

<p>"<i>Oh, l√† l√†!</i> Well, she has told the Crown-Princess
that you are her friend, and, in brief, has entirely
fascinated Her Imperial Highness."</p>

<p>I gasped. At what a pass we had arrived when
the Crown-Princess was receiving that old woman
whose reputation was of the gayest and most scandalous!</p>

<p>What the <i>Grande Ma√Ætresse</i> had told me was perfectly
correct, for three days later a dance was held,
and as I entered the room I saw amid that gay
assemblage the yellow-haired old widow of the long-forgotten
military hero wagging her lace fan and talking
quite familiarly with Her Imperial Highness. To
my utter amazement also, His Majesty the Emperor,
in the gay uniform of the 3rd Regiment of Uhlans
of Saxony&mdash;of whom he was chief, among a hundred-and-one
other high military distinctions&mdash;advanced
and smiled graciously upon her as she bowed as low
as rheumatism and old age allowed.</p>

<p>The fascination which the ugly, shrill-voiced old
woman exercised over "Cilli" was quickly remarked,
and, of course, gossip became more rife than ever,
especially when, a week later, it was announced that
she had actually been appointed a lady-in-waiting.</p>

<p>The Crown-Prince, too, soon became on friendly
terms with her, and many times I saw them chatting
together as though exchanging confidences. Why?</p>

<p>His Highness, usually so utterly piggish towards
ladies, given to snubbing even the highest-born in the
Empire, was always smiling and gracious towards her.</p>

<p>"I can't make it out," declared Von Behr, the
Chamberlain <i>du service</i>, to me one day two months
later, while I was smoking with him in his room.
"The old woman has the most complete control over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
Her Highness. Because she was averse to the
journey, we are not going to Norway this year.
Besides, since her appointment she has succeeded in
plotting the dismissal of both Countess von Scheet-Plessen
and Countess von Brockdorff."</p>

<p>"I know," I replied. I had been discussing it
only a few hours before with Major von Amsberg,
aide-de-camp of the Prince Eitel Fr√©d√©ric, and he, too,
had expressed himself both mystified and disgusted
with the mysterious power exercised by the old woman
in the yellow wig. "It seems so extraordinary," I
went on, "that the Court should so utterly disregard
the woman's reputation."</p>

<p>"Bah, my dear Heltzendorff!" laughed the
Chamberlain. "When a woman arrives at seventy
she has outlived all the peccadilloes of youth. And,
after all, the reputations of most of us here are
tarnished&mdash;more or less&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>His remarks were indeed true. Nevertheless, it
did not lessen the mystery of the appointment of the
little old Countess as a lady-in-waiting, nor did it
account for the strange influence which she held over
the Imperial pair.</p>

<p>One evening I went to the Countess's house in the
Stulerstrasse to a dinner-party, at which there
were present the Crown-Prince, Admiral von Spee
from Kiel, and Von Ilberg, the Emperor's doctor,
together with the old Duke von Trachenberg, who held
the honorary and out-of-date office of grand cupbearer
to the Emperor, and the eternal "Uncle"
Zeppelin. With us were a number of ladies, including
their Serene Highnesses the Princess von Radolin
and the Duchess von Ratibor, both ladies of the Court
of the Kaiserin, and several others of the ultra-smart
set.</p>

<p>After the meal there was a small dance, and about
midnight, after waltzing with a pretty girl, the
daughter of the Baron von Heintze-Weissenrode, we
strolled together into the fine winter garden with its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
high palms, its plashing fountains, and its cunningly-secreted
electric lights.</p>

<p>I was seated with her, chatting gaily, for we had
met in July at Stubbenkammer, on the island of
R√ºgen. She had been staying with her father at
Eichstadt's, in Nipmerow, and we had all three been
on some pleasant excursions along the Baltic coast,
with its picturesque beech woods, white cliffs, and
blue bays.</p>

<p>We were recalling a delightful excursion up to
the Herthaburg, on the road to Sassnitz, that "altar
of sacrifice" which tradition connects with the
mysterious rites of the beautiful goddess Hertha,
mentioned by Tacitus, when suddenly we overheard
voices.</p>

<p>Two persons were approaching somewhere behind
us, conversing in Italian&mdash;a man and a woman.</p>

<p>"Hush!" I whispered mischievously. "Listen!
Do you know Italian?"</p>

<p>"Alas! no," was her reply. "Do you?"</p>

<p>I did not answer, for I had already recognized the
voices as those of our hostess and the Crown-Prince.</p>

<p>Next moment, however, my companion's quick
ears caught that unmistakable squeaky voice.</p>

<p>"Why, it's the Countess!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>I made no reply, but continued to recall that
glorious summer's day beside the blue Baltic, while
His Highness and the little old lady-in-waiting seated
themselves out of sight a short distance away, and
continued a very confidential discussion in an undertone
in the language in which, after German, I
happened perhaps to be most proficient.</p>

<p>The pair were discussing somebody named Karl
Krahl, and the curious discussion was undoubtedly
regarding some evil intent.</p>

<p>"I saw the Emperor to-day," declared the old
woman in her sibilant Italian, so that no one should
understand, for Italian is seldom spoken in Germany.
"His Majesty shares my views now, though he did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
not do so at first. Indeed, I was very near being
dismissed in disgrace when I first broached the
affair. But, fortunately, he now knows the truth and
sees the advantage of&mdash;well, you know, eh?"</p>

<p>"<i>Certo, Contessa</i>," replied the Crown-Prince, who
speaks Italian extremely well, though not with half
the fluency of his hostess. "I quite foresee the peril
and the force of your argument."</p>

<p>"How shall we act?" asked the old woman.
"It remains for you to devise a plan. At any
moment matters may approach a crisis. One can
never account for the confidences exchanged by
those who love each other. And, remember, Krahl
is in love."</p>

<p>The Crown-Prince grunted, but as several couples
entered at that moment the pair suddenly broke off
their confidential chat, and, rising, went out together.</p>

<p>Who was this Karl Krahl against whom some deep-laid
plot was levelled?</p>

<p>I searched various directories, lists of persons
engaged in the Government offices in the Wilhelmstrasse,
the Leipzigerstrasse, and Unter den Linden;
I consulted the Director of Berlin Police, Von Jagow;
the well-known Detective Schunke, and Heinrich
Wesener, Assistant-Director of the Secret Service of
the General Staff; but nobody knew Karl Krahl.
There seemed to be no record of him anywhere.</p>

<p>In October I went with the Crown-Prince and the
Emperor upon a round of ceremonial military inspections
to the garrisons in Silesia&mdash;namely, Breslau,
Leignitz, and Oppeln&mdash;and afterwards to L√ºbeck,
where we presented new colours to two regiments.
Thence, while the Emperor and his Staff returned
direct to Berlin, I accompanied His Imperial Highness
to Ballenstedt, the beautiful schloss in the Harz
Mountains. Here once or twice each season the
Crown-Prince's habit was to invite a few of his most
intimate chums to shoot in the forests of Stecklenberg
and the Lauenberg, and along that curious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
sandstone ridge known as the Teufelsmauer, or
"Devil's Wall."</p>

<p>The sport was always excellent, especially about
the romantic district of Neue Schenke, near Suderode.</p>

<p>The guns consisted of five well-known officers from
Berlin, together with Dr. Zeising, the Master-General
of Forests, and Lieut.-General von Oertzen, the fat
old Inspector-General of Cavalry. As usual, we all
had a most enjoyable time.</p>

<p>On the third day, after a champagne luncheon
taken at the forester's little house at Neue Schenke,
we were about to resume our sport. Indeed, all the
guests had gone outside, preparing to go to their
allotted stations, when the head forester, a stalwart
man in green livery, entered, and, addressing the
Crown-Prince, said:</p>

<p>"There is a man to see Your Imperial Highness,
and refuses to leave. He gives his name as Karl
Krahl."</p>

<p>In an instant I pricked up my ears.</p>

<p>His Highness's brows narrowed for a second,
which showed his annoyance, then, smiling affably,
so clever was he, like his Imperial father, in the
concealment of his real feelings&mdash;he replied:</p>

<p>"Oh, yes&mdash;Krahl! I recollect. Yes, I will see
him here."</p>

<p>Next moment the person whom I had heard discussed
so strangely in the little old woman's beautiful
winter garden was ushered in.</p>

<p>He was dark-haired, aged about twenty-eight, I
judged, with small, shrewd black eyes, dressed in a
well-cut suit of grey country tweeds, and but for his
German name I should have taken him for an English
tourist, one of those familiar objects of the Harz in
peace time. His appearance instantly interested me,
the more so owing to the fact that he had come to
that remote spot and at that hour to pay a visit to
the Emperor's son.</p>

<p>"Come in, Karl!" exclaimed the Crown-Prince<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
affably, as he grasped his visitor's hand. His Highness
did not often offer his manicured hand to others,
and at this I was, I admit, greatly surprised. "The
forester did not know you, of course. Well, I am
very pleased to see you. Have you come straight
here?"</p>

<p>"Yes, your Highness. I went first to Berlin, and
learning that you were here I thought I had better
lose no time."</p>

<p>"Quite right," laughed his Highness who, turning
to me, said: "Heltzendorff, will you tell the others
to go on&mdash;that I am detained for an hour on State
business, and&mdash;and that I will join them as soon as
possible. I will find you in the woods, on the left of
the Quedlinburg Road, before one comes to the
Wurmtal. Apologize for me, but the delay is
inevitable. I have a conference with Herr Krahl."</p>

<p>While His Highness remained behind at the
forester's house to chat alone with the mysterious
Karl Krahl, we went out among the birds and had
some excellent sport. Yet the sight of that ferret-eyed
young man, whom I had long endeavoured in
vain to trace, caused me considerable wonderment.
Who was that young fellow in whom the little old
Countess seemed to take such deep and peculiar
interest? What was his offence that she, with the
Crown-Prince, should concoct, as it seemed to me,
such a plot as that I had partly overheard?</p>

<p>That there was a woman in the case I felt assured,
but her name had not been mentioned, and I had no
suspicion of whom it could be. I realized, however,
that something important must be in progress, otherwise
His Highness, devoted to sport as he was,
would never have given up the best afternoon to
consult with that stranger in grey tweeds.</p>

<p>The forester and beaters had come with us, as the
Crown-Prince had, at his own request, been left alone
with his mysterious visitor.</p>

<p>After a couple of short beats we arrived at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
spot on the forest road to Quedlinburg, a most
romantic and picturesque gorge, where His Highness
had arranged to meet us, and there we sat down and
waited. Both Von Oertzen and Dr. Zeising, being
unduly stout, had been puffed in coming up the
steep mountain side, and as we sat we gossiped,
though impatient to set forth again.</p>

<p>A full half-hour had passed, yet the head forester,
who was keeping a look-out along the road, did not
signal His Highness's approach.</p>

<p>"I wonder what can have detained him?"
remarked the Inspector-General of Cavalry.</p>

<p>I explained that a strange young man had come
to the forester's house.</p>

<p>"Well," laughed a smart young lieutenant of
Uhlans, "I could have understood the delay if it
had been a lady!"</p>

<p>An hour went past. The light would soon fade,
and we, knowing "Willie's" utter disregard for his
appointments, at last decided to continue the shoot,
leaving one of the foresters to tell His Highness the
direction we had taken.</p>

<p>The Crown-Prince did not, however, join us, and
darkness had fallen ere we returned to the forester's
house. Of His Highness there was no sign, a fact
which much surprised us. In the room wherein I
had left him his gun and green Tyrolese hat were
lying upon a chair, and the fact that all the cars
were still ranged outside showed that he had not
driven back to the castle.</p>

<p>The Crown-Prince had disappeared!</p>

<p>Knof, His Highness's chauffeur, who had been
walking with us, was sent back post-haste to the
schloss to ascertain whether he had been seen there,
for His Highness's movements were often most
erratic. We knew that if the whim took him he
would perhaps go off in an opposite direction, or
trudge back to the castle with utter disregard of our
natural anxiety.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>Lights were lit, and we enjoyed cigars awaiting
Knof's return. In an hour he was back with the
news that nothing had been heard of His Highness.
Soon after we had left that morning, however, a
young man in a grey suit had called and seen the
major-domo, who had directed him where His Highness
might be found.</p>

<p>Upon Eckardt&mdash;the commissary of police responsible
for His Highness's safety&mdash;the onus rested.
Yet, had he not been sent out with the party, as His
Highness had expressed to me a wish to be left alone
with the stranger, whose name I alone knew.</p>

<p>While we were discussing the most judicious mode
of action&mdash;for I scented much mystery in this visit
of Karl Krahl&mdash;one of the party suddenly discovered,
lying upon the ledge of the window, a lady's small
and rather elegant handbag of black <i>moir√©</i> silk.</p>

<p>"Hulloa!" I cried when he held it up for inspection.
"This reveals to us one fact&mdash;a woman has
been here!"</p>

<p>I opened the bag, and within found a small lawn
handkerchief with a coronet embroidered in its
corner, a tiny tortoise-shell mirror, and four one-hundred-mark
notes, but no clue whatever as to its
owner.</p>

<p>The mystery was increasing hourly, but the gay
party, knowing "Willie's" susceptibility where the
fair sex were concerned, only laughed and declared
that His Highness would assuredly turn up before
the evening was over.</p>

<p>Truth to tell, I did not like the situation. His
Highness's disappearance was now known to fifty
or so persons, beaters, and others, and I feared lest
it might get into the Berlin papers. With that
object I called them together and impressed upon
them that most complete silence must be maintained
regarding the affair.</p>

<p>Then Knof drove me alone back to the schloss.
I wondered if His Highness, wishing to get away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
unobserved, returning in secret there, had left me a
written message in his room. He had done that on
one occasion before.</p>

<p>I dashed up to the small, old-world room which by
day overlooked the romantic and picturesque valley,
but upon the table whereat I had been writing early
that morning there was nothing.</p>

<p>As I turned to leave I heard a footstep, and next
instant saw the little deformed old Countess facing
me.</p>

<p>Her appearance quite startled me. Apparently
she had just arrived, for she was in a dark blue bonnet
and warm travelling coat.</p>

<p>"Ah! Count von Heltzendorff!" she cried in
that squeaky, high-pitched voice of hers. "Is His
Imperial Highness here? I must see him immediately."</p>

<p>"No, Countess. His Imperial Highness is not
here," was my reply. "This afternoon he mysteriously
disappeared from the forester's lodge at
Neue Schenke, and we are unable to trace him."</p>

<p>"Disappeared!" gasped the old lady, instantly
pale and agitated.</p>

<p>"Yes," I said, looking her straight in the face.</p>

<p>"Do you know whether he had a visitor to-day&mdash;a
young, dark-haired man?"</p>

<p>"He had, Countess. A man called, and saw him.
At His Highness's request I left him alone with his
visitor at the forester's house. The man's name was
Karl Krahl."</p>

<p>"How did you know his name?" she asked,
staring at me with an expression of distinct suspicion.</p>

<p>"Because&mdash;well, because I happen to have learnt
it some time ago," I said. "And, further, on returning
to the house we found this little bag in the room
wherein I had left the Crown-Prince."</p>

<p>"Why!&mdash;a lady's bag!" she exclaimed as I held
it out for inspection.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," I said in a somewhat hard tone. "Do
you happen to recognize it?"</p>

<p>"Me? Why?" asked the old woman.</p>

<p>"Well, because I think it is your own property,"
I said with a sarcastic smile. "I have some recollection
of having seen it in your hand!"</p>

<p>She took it, examined it well, and then, with a
hollow, artificial laugh, declared:</p>

<p>"It certainly is not mine. I once had a bag very
similar, but mine was not of such good quality."</p>

<p>"Are you really quite certain, Countess?" I
demanded in a low, persuasive voice.</p>

<p>"Quite," she declared, though I knew that she
was lying to me. "But why trouble about that
bag while there is a point much more important&mdash;the
safety and whereabouts of His Imperial Highness?"
she went on in a great state of agitation.
"Tell me, Count, exactly what occurred&mdash;as far as
you know."</p>

<p>I recounted to her the facts just as you have
already written them down, and as I did so I watched
her thin, crafty old face, noticing upon it an expression
full of suspicion of myself. She was, I now
realized, undecided as to the exact extent of my
knowledge.</p>

<p>"How did you know that the young man's name
was Krahl?" she asked eagerly. "You had perhaps
met him before&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>But to this leading question I maintained a sphinx-like
silence. That the little old woman who had so
unexpectedly become a lady-in-waiting was playing
some desperate double game I felt sure, but its exact
import was still an enigma.</p>

<p>"In any case," she said, "would it not be as well
to return to the Neue Schenke and make search?"</p>

<p>I smiled. Then, in order to let her know that I
was acquainted with Italian, the language she had
spoken on that well-remembered night in her own
conservatory, I exclaimed:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ahe! alle volte con gli occhi aperti si far dei
sogni." (Sometimes one can dream with one's eyes
open.)</p>

<p>Her thin eyebrows narrowed, and with a shrug of
her shoulders the clever old woman replied:</p>

<p>"Dal false bene viene il vero male." (From an
affected good feeling comes a real evil.)</p>

<p>I realized at that moment that there was more
mystery in the affair than I had yet conceived. His
Imperial Highness was certainly missing, though the
female element of the affair had become eliminated by
my recognition of her own handbag. She, too, had
been in secret to the forester's house&mdash;but with what
object?</p>

<p>Half an hour later we were back at the little house
in the forest.</p>

<p>The guests had all returned to the castle, and only
Eckardt, the police commissary, remained, with the
forester and his underlings. Already search had
been made in the surrounding woods, but without
result. Of his Imperial Highness there was no trace.</p>

<p>In the long room, with its pitch-pine walls, and lit
by oil lamps, the crafty old Countess closely questioned
Eckardt as to the result of his inquiries. But
the police official, who had become full of nervous
fear, declared that he had been sent off by His Highness,
and had not since found any trace of him.
He spoke of the little black silk bag, of course, and
attached great importance to it.</p>

<p>Within half an hour we had reorganized the
beaters from the neighbourhood and, with lanterns,
set out again to examine some woods to the east
which had not been searched. About ten o'clock we
set forth, the Countess accompanying us and walking
well, notwithstanding her age, though I could see
that it was a fearful anxiety that kept her active.
To the men with us every inch of the mountain side
was familiar, and for hours we searched.</p>

<p>Suddenly, not far away, a horn was blown, followed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
by loud shouts. Quickly we approached the spot,
and Eckardt and myself, as we came up, looked upon
a strange scene. Close to the trunk of a great beech
tree lay the form of the Crown-Prince, hatless, outstretched
upon his face.</p>

<p>Instantly I bent, tore open his shooting jacket,
and to my great relief found that his heart was still
beating. He was, however, quite unconscious,
though there seemed no sign of a struggle. As he
had left his hat and gun in the house, it seemed that
he had gone forth only for a moment. And yet we
were quite a mile from the forester's house!</p>

<p>The Countess had thrown herself upon her knees
and stroked his brow tenderly when I announced that
he was still living. By her actions I saw that she
was filled by some bitter self-reproach.</p>

<p>With the lanterns shining around him&mdash;surely a
weird and remarkable scene which would, if described
by the journalists, have caused a great sensation in
Europe&mdash;the Crown-Prince was brought slowly back
to consciousness, until at last he sat up, dazed and
wondering.</p>

<p>His first words to me were:</p>

<p>"That fellow! Where is he? That&mdash;that glass
globe!"</p>

<p>Glass globe! Surely His Highness's mind was
wandering.</p>

<p>An hour later he was comfortably in bed in the
great old-world room in the castle, attended by a local
doctor&mdash;upon whom I set the seal of official silence&mdash;and
before dawn he had completely recovered.</p>

<p>Yet, even to me, he declared that he retained
absolutely no knowledge of what had occurred.</p>

<p>"I went out quickly, and I&mdash;well, I don't know
what happened," he told me soon after dawn, as he
lay in bed. Strangely enough, he made no mention
of the man, Karl Krahl.</p>

<p>Later on he summoned the Countess von Kienitz,
and for twenty minutes or so he had an animated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
discussion with her. Being outside the room, however,
I was unable to hear distinctly.</p>

<p>Well, I succeeded, by bribes and threats, in hushing
up the whole affair and keeping it out of the papers,
while by those who knew of the incident it was soon
forgotten.</p>

<p>I suppose it must have been fully three months
later when one evening, having taken some documents
over to the Emperor for signature at the Berlin
Schloss, I returned to the Prince's private room in
the Palace, when, to my great surprise, I found the
man Karl Krahl seated there. He looked very pale
and worn, quite unlike the rather athletic figure he
presented at the forester's house.</p>

<p>"If you still refuse to tell me the truth, then I shall
take my own measures to find out&mdash;severe measures!
So I give you full warning," the Crown-Prince was
declaring angrily, as I entered so unexpectedly.</p>

<p>I did not withdraw, pretending not to notice the
presence of a visitor, therefore His Highness himself
beckoned the young man, who followed him down
the corridor to another room.</p>

<p>The whole affair was most puzzling. What had
happened on that afternoon in the Harz Mountains
I could not at all imagine. By what means had His
Highness been rendered unconscious, and what part
could the little old Countess have played in the curious
affair?</p>

<p>In about half an hour the Crown-Prince returned
in a palpably bad humour, and, flinging himself
into his chair, wrote a long letter, which he addressed
to Countess von Kienitz. This he sealed carefully,
and ordered me to take it at once to the Stulerstrasse
and deliver it to her personally.</p>

<p>"The Countess left for Stockholm this morning,"
I was informed by the bearded manservant. "She
left by the eight o'clock train, and has already left
Sassnitz by now."</p>

<p>"When do you expect her to return?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>The man did not know.</p>

<p>On going back to His Highness and telling him of
the Countess's departure, he bit his lip and then
smiled grimly.</p>

<p>"That infernal old woman has left Germany, and
will never again put her foot upon our soil, Heltzendorff,"
he said. "You may open that letter. It
will explain something which I know must have
mystified you."</p>

<p>I did so. And as I read what he had written I
held my breath. Truly, it did explain much.</p>

<p>Imposing the strictest silence upon me, the Crown-Prince
then revealed how utterly he and the Crown-Princess
had been misled, and how very narrowly he
had escaped being the victim of a cunning plot to
effect his death.</p>

<p>The little old Countess von Kienitz had, it seemed,
sworn to avenge the degradation and dismissal of her
son, who had been in the famous Death's Head
Hussars. She had secretly traced the Crown-Prince
as author of a subtle conspiracy against him, the
underlying motive being jealousy. With that end
in view she had slowly wormed her way into His
Highness's confidence, and introduced to him Karl
Krahl, a neurotic young Saxon who lived in London,
and who pretended he had unearthed a plot against
the Kaiser himself.</p>

<p>"It was to tell me the truth concerning the conspiracy
that Krahl came to me in secret at Ballenstedt.
He remained with me for half an hour, when,
to my great surprise, we were joined by the Countess.
The story they told me of the plot against the Emperor
was a very alarming one, and I intended to return
at once to Berlin. The Countess had left to walk
back to the schloss, when presently we heard a
woman's scream&mdash;her voice&mdash;and we both went
forth to discover what was in progress. As I ran
along a little distance behind Krahl, suddenly what
seemed like a thin glass globe struck me in the chest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
and burst before my face. It had been thrown by an
unknown hand, and, on breaking, must have emitted
some poisonous gas which was intended to kill me,
but which happily failed. Until yesterday the whole
affair was a complete mystery, but Krahl has now
confessed that the Countess conceived the plot, and
that the hand that had thrown the glass bomb was
that of her son, who had concealed himself in the
bushes for that purpose."</p>

<p>Though, of course, I hastened to congratulate His
Highness upon his fortunate escape, yet I now often
wonder whether, if the plot had succeeded, the
present world-conflict would ever have occurred.</p>

<h2><a name="SECRET_NUMBER_SEVEN" id="SECRET_NUMBER_SEVEN"></a>SECRET NUMBER SEVEN</h2>
<h3>THE BRITISH GIRL WHO BAULKED THE KAISER</h3>


<p>"How completely we have put to sleep these
very dear cousins of ours, the British!"
His Imperial Highness the Crown-Prince made this
remark to me as he sat in the corner of a first-class
compartment of an express that had ten minutes
before left Paddington Station for the West of England&mdash;that
much-advertised train known as the
Cornish-Riviera Express.</p>

<p>The Crown-Prince, though not generally known,
frequently visited England and Scotland incognito,
usually travelling as Count von Gr√ºnau, and we were
upon one of these flying visits on that bright summer's
morning as the express tore through your delightful
English scenery of the Thames Valley, with the first
stopping-place at Plymouth, our destination.</p>

<p>The real reason for the visit of my young hotheaded
Imperial Master was concealed from me.</p>

<p>Four days before he had dashed into my room at
the Marmor Palace at Potsdam greatly excited. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
had been with the Emperor in Berlin all the morning,
and had motored back with all speed. Something had
occurred, but what it was I failed to discern. He
carried some papers in the pocket of his military
tunic. From their colour I saw that they were secret
reports&mdash;those documents prepared solely for the eyes
of the Kaiser and those of his precious son.</p>

<p>He took a big linen-lined envelope and, placing
the papers in it, carefully sealed it with wax.</p>

<p>"We are going to London, Heltzendorff. Put that
in your dispatch-box. I may want it when we are
in England."</p>

<p>"To London&mdash;when?" I asked, much surprised
at the suddenness of our journey, because I knew
that we were due at Weimar in two days' time.</p>

<p>"We leave at six o'clock this evening," was the
Crown-Prince's reply. "Koehler has ordered the
saloon to be attached to the Hook of Holland train.
Hardt has already left Berlin to engage rooms for
us at the 'Ritz,' in London."</p>

<p>"And the suite?" I asked, for it was one of my
duties to arrange who travelled with His Imperial
Highness.</p>

<p>"Oh! we'll leave Eckardt at home," he said, for
he always hated the surveillance of the Commissioner
of Secret Police. "We shall only want Schuler, my
valet, and Knof."</p>

<p>We never travelled anywhere without Knof, the
chauffeur, who was an impudent, arrogant young
man, intensely disliked by everyone.</p>

<p>And so it was that the four of us duly landed at
Harwich and travelled to London, our identity unknown
to the jostling crowd of Cook's tourists returning
from their annual holiday on the Continent.</p>

<p>At the "Ritz," too, though we took our meals in
the restaurant, that great square white room overlooking
the Park, "Willie" was not recognized,
because all photographs of him show him in elegant
uniform. In a tweed suit, or in evening clothes, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
presents an unhealthy, weedy and somewhat insignificant
figure, save for those slant animal eyes of his
which are always so striking in his every mood.</p>

<p>His Imperial Highness had been on the previous
day to Carlton House Terrace to a luncheon given
by the Ambassador's wife, but to which nobody was
invited but the Embassy staff.</p>

<p>And that afternoon in the great dining-room, in
full view of St. James's Park and Whitehall, the toast
of "The Day" was drunk enthusiastically&mdash;the
day of Great Britain's intended downfall.</p>

<p>That same evening an Imperial courier arrived from
Berlin and called at the "Ritz," where, on being
shown into the Crown-Prince's sitting-room, he handed
His Highness a sealed letter from his wife.</p>

<p>"Willie," on reading it, became very grave.
Then, striking a match, he lit it, and held it until
it was consumed. There was a second letter&mdash;which
I saw was from the Emperor. This he also read,
and then gave vent to an expression of impatience.
For a few minutes he reflected, and it was then he
announced that we must go to Plymouth next day.</p>

<p>On arrival there we went to the Royal Hotel, where
the Crown-Prince registered as Mr. Richter, engaging
a private suite of rooms for himself and his secretary,
myself. For three days we remained there, taking
motor runs to Dartmoor, and also down into Cornwall,
until on the morning of the fourth day the
Crown-Prince suddenly said:</p>

<p>"I shall probably have a visitor this morning about
eleven o'clock&mdash;a young lady named King. Tell
them at the bureau to send her up to my sitting-room."</p>

<p>At the time appointed the lady came. I received
her in the lobby of the self-contained flat, and found
her to be about twenty-four, well-dressed, fair-haired
and extremely good-looking. Knowing the Crown-Prince's
<i>penchant</i> for the petticoat, I saw at once the
reason of our journey down to Plymouth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss King, I learned, was an English girl who some
years previously had gone to America with her
people, and by the heavy travelling coat and close-fitting
hat she wore I concluded that she had just
come off one of the incoming American liners.</p>

<p>One thing which struck me as I looked at her was
the brooch she wore. It was a natural butterfly of
a rare tropical variety, with bright golden wings,
the delicate sheen of which was protected by small
plates of crystal&mdash;one of the most charming ornaments
I had ever seen.</p>

<p>As I ushered her in she greeted the Crown-Prince
as "Mr. Richter," being apparently entirely unaware
of his real identity. I concluded that she was somebody
whom His Highness had met in Germany, and
to whom he had been introduced under his assumed
name.</p>

<p>"Ah! Miss King!" he exclaimed pleasantly in his
excellent English, shaking hands with her. "Your
boat should have been in yesterday. I fear you
encountered bad weather&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes, rather," replied the girl. "But it did not
trouble me much. We had almost constant gales
ever since we left New York," she laughed brightly.
She appeared to be quite a charming little person.
But his fast-living Highness was perhaps one of the
best judges of a pretty face in all Europe, and I now
realized why we had travelled all the way from
Potsdam to Plymouth.</p>

<p>"Heltzendorff, would you please bring me that
sealed packet from your dispatch-box?" he asked,
suddenly turning to me.</p>

<p>The sealed packet! I had forgotten all about it
ever since he had handed it me at the door of the
Marmor Palace. I knew that it contained some
secret reports prepared for the eye of the Emperor.
The latter had no doubt seen them, for the Crown-Prince
had brought them with him from Berlin.</p>

<p>As ordered, I took the packet into the room where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
His Highness sat with his fair visitor, and then I
retired and closed the door.</p>

<p>Hotel doors are never very heavy, as a rule, therefore
I was able to hear conversation, but unfortunately
few words were distinct. The interview had
lasted nearly half an hour. Finding that I could
hear nothing, I contented myself in reading the
paper and holding myself in readiness should "Mr.
Richter" want me.</p>

<p>Of a sudden I heard His Highness's voice raised
in anger, that shrill, high-pitched note which is
peculiar both to the Emperor and to his son when
they are unusually annoyed.</p>

<p>"But I tell you, Miss King, there is no other
way," I heard him shout. "It can be done quite
easily, and nobody can possibly know."</p>

<p>"Never!" cried the girl. "What would people
think of me?"</p>

<p>"You wish to save your brother," he said.
"Very well, I have shown you how you can effect
this. And I will help you if you agree to the terms&mdash;if
you will find out what I want to know."</p>

<p>"I can't!" cried the girl, in evident distress.
"I really can't! It would be dishonest&mdash;criminal!"</p>

<p>"Bah! my dear girl, you are looking at the affair
from far too high a standpoint," replied the man
she knew as Richter. "It is a mere matter of business.
You ask me to assist you to save your brother,
and I have simply stated my terms. Surely you
would not think that I should travel from Berlin
here to Plymouth in order to meet you if I were not
ready and eager to help you?"</p>

<p>"I must ask my father. I can speak to him in
confidence."</p>

<p>"Your father!" shrieked Mr. Richter in alarm.
"By no means. Why, you must not breathe a
single word to him. This affair is a strict secret
between us. Please understand that." Then, after
a pause, he asked in a lower and more serious voice:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>"Your brother is, I quite admit, in direst peril,
and you alone can save him. Now, what is your
decision?"</p>

<p>The girl's reply was in a tone too low for me to
overhear. Its tenor, however, was quickly apparent
from the Crown-Prince's words:</p>

<p>"You refuse! Very well, then, I cannot assist
you. I regret, Miss King, that you have had your
journey to England for nothing."</p>

<p>"But won't you help me, Mr. Richter?" cried the
girl appealingly. "Do, do, Mr. Richter!"</p>

<p>"No," was his cold answer. "I will, however,
give you opportunity to reconsider your decision.
You are, no doubt, going to London. So am I.
You will meet me in the hall of the Carlton Hotel at
seven o'clock on Thursday evening, and we will dine
together."</p>

<p>"But I can't&mdash;I really can't do as you wish.
You surely will not compel me to&mdash;to commit a
crime!"</p>

<p>"Hush!" he cried. "I have shown you these
papers, and you know my instructions. Remember
that your father must know nothing. Nobody
must suspect, or you will find yourself in equal peril
with your brother."</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you are cruel!" sobbed the girl. "Horribly
cruel!"</p>

<p>"No, no," he said cheerfully. "Don't cry, please.
Think it all over, Miss King, and meet me in London
on Thursday night."</p>

<p>After listening to the appointment I discreetly
withdrew into the corridor on pretence of summoning
a waiter, and when I returned the pretty English
girl was taking leave of "Mr. Richter."</p>

<p>Her blue eyes betrayed traces of emotion, and she
was, I saw, very pale, her bearing quite unlike her
attitude when she had entered there.</p>

<p>"Well, good-bye, Miss King," said His Highness,
grasping her hand. "It was really awfully good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
of you to call. We shall meet again very soon&mdash;eh?
Good-bye."</p>

<p>Then, turning to me, he asked me to conduct
her out.</p>

<p>I walked by her side along the corridor and down
the stairs, but as we went along she suddenly turned
to me, remarking:</p>

<p>"I wonder if all men are alike?"</p>

<p>"Alike, why?" I asked, surprised.</p>

<p>"Mr. Richter&mdash;ah! he has a heart of stone," she
declared. "My poor brother!" she added, in a
voice broken in emotion. "I have travelled from
America in order to try and save him ere it is too
late."</p>

<p>"Mr. Richter is your friend&mdash;eh?" I asked as we
descended.</p>

<p>"Yes. I met him at Frankenhausen two years
ago. I had gone there with my father to visit the
Barbarossa Cavern."</p>

<p>"Then you have lived in Germany?"</p>

<p>"Yes, for several years."</p>

<p>By this time we were at the door of the hotel,
and I bowed to her as she smiled sadly and, wishing
me adieu, passed out into the street.</p>

<p>On returning to the Crown-Prince, I found him in
a decidedly savage mood. He was pacing the floor
impatiently, muttering angrily to himself, for it was
apparent that some deeply-laid plan of his was being
thwarted by the girl's refusal to conform to his
wishes and obtain certain information he was seeking.</p>

<p>The Crown-Prince, when in a foreign country, was
never idle. His energy was such that he was ever
on the move, with eyes and ears always open to
learn whatever he could. Hence it was at two
o'clock that afternoon Knof brought round a big
grey open car, and in it I sat beside the Emperor's
son while we were driven around the defences of
Plymouth, just as on previous occasions we had
inspected those of Portsmouth and of Dover.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>On the following Thursday evening we had returned
to London, and the Crown-Prince, without telling me
where he was going, left the Ritz Hotel, merely explaining
that he might not be back till midnight.
It was on that occasion, my dear Le Queux, you will
remember, that I dined with you at the Devonshire
Club, and we afterwards spent a pleasant evening
together at the "Empire."</p>

<p>I merely told you that His Highness was out at
dinner with a friend. You were, naturally, inquisitive,
but I did not satisfy your curiosity.
Secrecy was my duty.</p>

<p>On returning to the hotel I found the Crown-Prince
arranging with Knof a motor run along the Surrey
hills on the following day. He had a large map
spread before him&mdash;a German military map, the
curious marks upon which would have no doubt
astonished any of your War Office officials. The map
indicated certain spots which had been secretly
prepared by Germany in view of the projected
invasion.</p>

<p>To those spots we motored on the following day.
His Imperial Highness, at the instigation of the Emperor,
actually made a tour of inspection of those
cunningly-concealed points of vantage which the
Imperial General Staff had, with their marvellous
forethought and bold enterprise, already prepared
right beneath the very nose of the sleeping British lion.</p>

<p>From the Crown-Prince's jaunty manner and good
spirits I felt assured that by the subtle persuasive
powers he possessed towards women&mdash;nearly all of
whom admired his corseted figure and his gay nonchalance&mdash;he
had brought the mysterious Miss King
into line with his own cunningly-conceived plans&mdash;whatever
they might be.</p>

<p>We lunched at the Burford Bridge Hotel, that
pretty old-fashioned house beneath Box Hill, not
far from Dorking.</p>

<p>After our meal in the long public room, newly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
built as an annexe, we strolled into the grounds
for a smoke.</p>

<p>"Well, Heltzendorff," he said presently, as we
strolled together along the gravelled walks, "we will
return to the Continent to-morrow. Our visit has
not been altogether abortive. We will remain a few
days in Ostend, before we return to Potsdam."</p>

<p>Next afternoon we had taken up our quarters at
a small but very select hotel on the Digue at Ostend,
a place called the "Beau S√©jour." It was patronized
by old-fashioned folk, and "Herr Richter" was well
known there. There may have been some who suspected
that Richter was not the visitor's real name,
but they were few, and it always surprised me how
well the Crown-Prince succeeded in preserving his
incognito&mdash;though, of course, the authorities knew
of the Imperial visit.</p>

<p>Whenever "Willie" went to Ostend his conduct
became anything but that of the exemplary husband.
Ostend in the season was assuredly a gay place, and
the Crown-Prince had a small and select coterie of
friends there who drank, gambled and enjoyed themselves
even more than they did at Nice in winter.</p>

<p>But his mind was always obsessed by the coming
war. Indeed, on that very evening of our arrival, as
we strolled along the gaily-illuminated Digue towards
the big, bright Kursaal, he turned to me suddenly
and said:</p>

<p>"When the hour comes, and Prussia in her greatness
strikes them, this place will soon become German
territory. I shall make that building yonder
my headquarters," and he jerked his thumb in the
direction of the summer palace of the King of the
Belgians.</p>

<p>The following day, about three o'clock, while the
Crown-Prince was carelessly going through some
letters brought by courier from Potsdam, a waiter
came to me with a message that a Miss King desired
to see Mr. Richter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>In surprise I received her, welcoming her to Ostend.
From the neat dress of the pretty English girl I concluded
that she had just crossed from Dover, and
she seemed most anxious to see His Highness. I
noted, too, that she still wore the beautiful golden
butterfly.</p>

<p>When I entered his room to announce her his slant
brows knit, and his thin lips compressed.</p>

<p>"H'm! More trouble for us, Heltzendorff, I
suppose!" he whispered beneath his breath. "Very
well, show her in."</p>

<p>The fair visitor was in the room for a long time&mdash;indeed,
for over an hour. Their voices were raised,
and now and then, curiously enough, I received the
impression that, whatever might have been the argument,
the pretty girl had gained her own point, for
when she came out she smiled at me in triumph, and
walked straight forth and down the stairs.</p>

<p>The Crown-Prince threw himself into a big arm-chair
in undisguised dissatisfaction. Towards me he
never wore a mask, though, like his father, he invariably
did so in the presence of strangers.</p>

<p>"Those accursed women!" he cried. "Ah!
Heltzendorff, when a woman is in love she will defy
even Satan himself! And yet they are fools, these
women, for they are in ignorance of the irresistible
power of our Imperial house. The enemies of the
Hohenzollerns are as a cloud of gnats on a summer's
night. The dew comes, and they are no more. It
is a pity," he added, with a sigh of regret. "But
those who are either conscientious or defiant must
suffer. Has not one of our greatest German philosophers
written: 'It is no use breathing against the
wind'?"</p>

<p>"True," I said. Then, hoping to learn something
further, I added: "Surely it is a nuisance to be
followed and worried by that little English girl!"</p>

<p>"Worried! Yes. You are quite right, my dear
Heltzendorff," he said. "But I do not mind worry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
if it is in the interests of Prussia, and of our House
of Hohenzollern. I admit the girl, though distinctly
pretty, is a most irritating person. She does not
appeal to me, but I am compelled to humour her,
because I have a certain object in view."</p>

<p>I could not go further, or I might have betrayed
the knowledge I had gained by eavesdropping.</p>

<p>"I was surprised that she should turn up here, in
Ostend," I said.</p>

<p>"I had written to her. I expected her."</p>

<p>"She does not know your real rank or station?"</p>

<p>"No. To her I am merely Herr Emil Richter,
whom she first met away in the country. She was a
tourist, and I was Captain Emil Richter, of the
Prussian Guards. We met while you were away on
holiday at Vienna."</p>

<p>I was anxious to learn something about Miss
King's brother, but "Willie" was generally discreet,
and at that moment unusually so. One fact was
plain, however, that some secret report presented
to the Emperor had been shown to her. Why? I
wondered if His Highness had been successful in
coercing her into acting as he desired.</p>

<p>Certainly the girl's attitude as she had left the
hotel went to show that, in the contest, she had
won by her woman's keen wit and foresight. I recollected,
too, that she was British.</p>

<p>A fortnight afterwards we were back again at
Potsdam.</p>

<p>About three months passed. The Crown-Prince
had accompanied the Emperor to shoot on the
Glatzer Gebirge, that wild mountainous district
beyond Breslau. For a week we had been staying
at a great, high-up, prison-like schloss, the ancestral
home of Prince Ludwig Lichtenau, in the W√∂lfelsgrund.</p>

<p>The Emperor and his suite had left, and our host
had been suddenly called to Berlin by telegram, his
daughter having been taken ill. Therefore, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
Crown-Prince and we of the suite had remained for
some further sport.</p>

<p>On the day after the Emperor's departure I spent
the afternoon in a small panelled room which overlooked
a deep mountain gorge, and which had been
given up to me for work. I was busy with correspondence
when the courier from Potsdam entered
and gave me the battered leather pouch containing
the Crown-Prince's letters. Having unlocked it
with my key, I found among the correspondence a
small square packet addressed to His Imperial Highness,
and marked "Private."</p>

<p>Now, fearing bombs or attempts by other means
upon his son's precious life, the Emperor had
commanded me always to open packets addressed
to him. This one, however, being marked "Private,"
and, moreover, the inscription being in a
feminine hand, I decided to await His Highness's
return.</p>

<p>When at last he came in, wet and very muddy after
a long day's sport, I showed him the packet. With
a careless air he said:</p>

<p>"Oh, open it, Heltzendorff. Open all packets,
whether marked private or not."</p>

<p>I obeyed, and to my surprise found within the
paper a small leather-covered jewel-case, in which,
reposing upon a bed of dark blue velvet, was the
beautiful ornament which I had admired at the
throat of the fair-haired British girl&mdash;the golden
butterfly.</p>

<p>I handed it to His Highness just as he was taking
a cigarette from the box on a side table.</p>

<p>The sight of it electrified him! He held his breath,
standing for a few seconds staring wildly at it as
though he were gazing upon some hideous spectre,
sight of which had frozen his senses.</p>

<p>He stood rigid, his thin countenance as white as
paper.</p>

<p>"When did that arrive?" he managed to ask,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
though in a hoarse voice, which showed how completely
sight of it had upset him.</p>

<p>"This afternoon. It was in the courier's pouch
from Potsdam."</p>

<p>He had grasped the back of a chair as though
to steady himself, and for a few seconds stood there,
with his left hand clapped over his eyes, endeavouring
to collect his thoughts.</p>

<p>He seemed highly nervous, and at the same time
extremely puzzled. Receipt of that unique and
beautiful brooch was, I saw, some sign, but of its
real significance I remained in entire ignorance.</p>

<p>That it had a serious meaning I quickly realized,
for within half an hour the Crown-Prince and myself
were in the train on our two-hundred-mile journey
back to Berlin.</p>

<p>On arrival His Imperial Highness drove straight
to the Berlin Schloss, and there had a long interview
with the Emperor. At last I was called into the
familiar pale-green room, the Kaiser's private
cabinet, and at once saw that something untoward
had occurred.</p>

<p>The Emperor's face was dark and thoughtful.
Yet another of the black plots of the Hohenzollerns
was in process of being carried out! Of that I felt
only too confident. The Crown-Prince, in his badly-creased
uniform, betraying a long journey&mdash;so unlike
his usual spick-and-span appearance&mdash;stood nervously
by as the Kaiser threw himself into his writing-chair
with a deep grunt and distinctly evil grace.</p>

<p>"I suppose it must be done," he growled viciously
to his son. "Did I not foresee that the girl would
constitute a serious menace? When she was in
Germany she might easily have been arrested upon
some charge and her mouth closed. Bah! our
political police service grows worse and worse. We
will have it entirely reorganized. The Director,
Laubach, is far too sentimental, far too chicken-hearted."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>As he spoke he took up his pen and commenced to
write rapidly, drawing a deep breath as his quill
scratched upon the paper.</p>

<p>"You realize," he exclaimed angrily to his son,
taking no notice of my presence there, because I was
part and parcel of the great machinery of the Court,
"you realize what this order means?" he added, as
he appended his signature. "It is a blow struck
against our cause&mdash;struck by a mere slip of a girl.
Think, if the truth came out! Why, all our propaganda
in the United States and Britain would be
nullified in a single day, and the 'good relations' we
are now extending on every hand throughout the
world in order to mislead our enemies would be
exposed in all their true meaning. We cannot afford
that. It would be far cheaper to pay twenty million
marks&mdash;the annual cost of the whole propaganda in
America&mdash;than to allow the truth to be known."</p>

<p>Suddenly the Crown-Prince's face brightened, as
though he had had some sudden inspiration.</p>

<p>"The truth will not be known, I promise you," he
said, with a strange, evil grin. I knew that
expression. It meant that he had devised some fresh
and devilish plan. "The girl is defiant to-day, but
she will not remain so long. I will take your order,
but I may not have occasion to put it in force."</p>

<p>"Ah! You have perhaps devised something&mdash;eh?
I hope so," said the Emperor. "You are
usually ingenious in a crisis. Good! Here is the
order; act just as you think fit."</p>

<p>"I was summoned, Your Majesty," I said, in order
to remind him of my presence there.</p>

<p>"Ah! Yes. You know this Miss King, do you
not?"</p>

<p>"I received her in Plymouth," was my reply.</p>

<p>"Ah! then you will again recognize her. Probably
your services may be very urgently required
within the next few hours. You may go," and His
Majesty curtly dismissed me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>I waited in the corridor until His Imperial Highness
came forth. When he did so he looked flushed and
seemed agitated.</p>

<p>There had, I knew, occurred a violent scene between
father and son, for to me it seemed as though
"Willie" had again fallen beneath the influence of
a pretty face.</p>

<p>He drove me in the big Merc√©d√®s over to Potsdam,
where I had a quantity of military documents awaiting
attention, and, after a change of clothes, I tackled
them.</p>

<p>Yet my mind kept constantly reverting to the
mystery surrounding the golden butterfly.</p>

<p>After dinner that night I returned again to my
workroom, when, upon my blotting-pad, I found a
note addressed to me in the Crown-Prince's sprawling
hand.</p>

<p>Opening it, I found that he had scribbled this
message:</p>

<blockquote><p>"<i>I have left. Tell Eckardt not to trouble. Come
alone, and meet me to-morrow night at the Palast Hotel,
in Hamburg. I shall call at seven o'clock and ask for
Herr Richter. I shall also use that name. Tell nobody
of my journey, not even the Crown-Princess. Explain
that I have gone to Berlin.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Wilhelm, Kronprinz.</span>"</p></blockquote>

<p>I read the note through a second time, and then
burned it.</p>

<p>Next day I arrived at the Palast Hotel, facing the
Binnenalster, in Hamburg, giving my name as Herr
Richter.</p>

<p>At seven o'clock I awaited His Highness. Eight
o'clock came&mdash;nine&mdash;ten&mdash;even eleven&mdash;midnight,
but, though I sat in the private room I had engaged,
no visitor arrived.</p>

<p>Just after twelve, however, a waiter brought up
a note addressed to Herr Richter.</p>

<p>Believing it to be meant for me, I opened it. To
my great surprise, I found that it was from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
mysterious Miss King, and evidently intended for
the Crown-Prince. It said:</p>

<blockquote><p>"<i>My brother was released from the Altona Prison this
evening&mdash;I presume, owing to your intervention&mdash;and
we are now both safely on our way across to Harwich.
You have evidently discovered at last that I am not the
helpless girl you believed me to be. When your German
police arrested my brother Walter in Bremen as a spy of
Britain I think you will admit that they acted very
injudiciously, in face of all that my brother and myself
know to-day. At Plymouth you demanded, as the price
of Walter's liberty, that I should become attached to your
secret service in America and betray the man who
adopted me and brought me up as his own daughter.
But you never dreamed the extent of my knowledge of
your country's vile intrigues; you did not know that,
through my brother and the man who adopted me as his
daughter, I know the full extent of your subtle propaganda.
You were, I admit, extremely clever, Herr
Richter, and I confess that I was quite charmed when
you sent me, as souvenir, that golden butterfly to the hotel
in Frankenhausen&mdash;that pretty ornament which I
returned to you as a mark of my refusal and defiance
of the conditions you imposed upon me for the release
of my brother from the sentence of fifteen years in a
fortress. This time, Herr Richter, a woman wins!
Further, I warn you that if you attempt any reprisal
my brother will at once expose Germany's machinations
abroad. He has, I assure you, many good friends, both
in Britain and America. Therefore if you desire silence
you will make no effort to trace me further. At Frankenhausen
you called me 'the golden-haired butterfly,' but
you regarded me merely as a moth! Adieu!</i>"</p></blockquote>

<p>Twelve hours later I handed that letter to the
Crown-Prince in Potsdam. Where he had been in the
meantime I did not know. He read it through;
then, with a fierce curse upon his thin, curled lips,
he crushed it in his hand and tossed it into the fire.</p>

<h2><a name="SECRET_NUMBER_EIGHT" id="SECRET_NUMBER_EIGHT"></a>SECRET NUMBER EIGHT</h2>
<h3>HOW THE CROWN-PRINCE WAS BLACKMAILED</h3>


<p>The Crown-Prince had accompanied the Emperor
on board the <i>Hohenzollern</i> on his annual
cruise up the Norwegian fjords, and the Kaiserin and
the Crown-Princess were of the party.</p>

<p>I had been left at home because I had not been
feeling well, and with relief had gone south to the
Lake of Garda, taking up my quarters in that long,
white hotel which faces the blue lake at Gardone-Riviera.
A truly beautiful spot, where the gardens
of the hotel run down to the lake's edge, with a long
veranda covered with trailing roses and geraniums,
peaceful indeed after the turmoil and glitter of our
Court life in Germany.</p>

<p>One morning at luncheon, however, just as I had
seated myself at my table set in the window overlooking
the sunlit waters, a tall, rather thin-faced,
bald-headed man entered, accompanied by an
extremely pretty girl, with very fair hair and eyes of
an unusual, child-like blue. The man I judged to be
about fifty-five, whose blotchy face marked him as
one addicted to strong liquors, and whose dress and
bearing proclaimed him to be something of a rou√©.
He walked jauntily to the empty table next mine,
while his companion stared vacantly about her as she
followed him to the place which the obsequious
<i>ma√Ætre d'h√¥tel</i> had indicated.</p>

<p>The stranger's eyes were dark, penetrating, and
shifty, while there was something about the young
girl's demeanour that aroused my interest. Her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
face, undeniably beautiful, was marred by a stare of
complete vacancy. She glanced at me, but I saw that
she did not see. It was as though her thoughts were
far away, or else that she was under the spell of some
weird fascination.</p>

<p>That strange, blank expression in her countenance
caused me to watch her. On the one hand, the man
had all the appearance of a person who had run the
whole gamut of the vices; while the fair-haired,
blue-eyed girl was the very incarnation of maiden
innocence.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was because I kept my eyes upon her
that the dark-eyed man knit his brows and stared at
me in defiance. Instinctively I did not like the
fellow, for as they started their meal I saw plainly
the rough, almost uncouth, manner in which he
treated her.</p>

<p>At first I believed that they might be father and
daughter, but this suggestion was negatived when, on
inquiry at the bureau, I was told that the man was
Martinez Aranda, of Seville, and that his companion
was his niece, Lola Serrano.</p>

<p>The latter always appeared exquisitely dressed,
and the gay young men, Italian officers and others,
were all eager to make her acquaintance. Yet it
seemed to me that the man Aranda forbade her to
speak to anyone. Indeed, I watched the pair closely
during the days following, and could plainly discern
that the girl went in mortal fear of him.</p>

<p>On the third day, while walking along the terrace
facing the lake, I came across the Spaniard, who, in
affable mood, started a conversation, and as we
leaned upon the stone balustrade, smoking and gossiping,
the pretty girl with hair so fair even though she
were a Southerner came up, and I was introduced.</p>

<p>She wore a cool white linen gown, a big sun-hat, and
carried a pale blue sunshade. But my eye, expert
where a woman's gown is concerned, told me that
that linen frock was the creation of one of the Paris<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
men-dressmakers, whose lowest charge for such a
garment is one thousand francs. Aranda and his
pretty niece were certainly persons of considerable
means.</p>

<p>"How very beautiful the lake always appears at
any hour!" the girl exclaimed in French after her
uncle had exchanged cards with me. "Truly Italy
is delightful."</p>

<p>"Ah, Mademoiselle," I replied. "But your
brilliant Spain is ever attractive."</p>

<p>"You know Spain?" inquired the bald-headed
man at once.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know Spain, but only as a spring visitor,"
was my reply.</p>

<p>And from that conversation there grew in a few
days quite an affable friendship. We went together
on excursions, all three of us, once by the steamer up
to Riva, where on landing and passing through the
Customs we sat at the caf√© and sipped that delicious
coffee topped by a foam of cream, the same as one
got at the "Bristol" in Vienna, or the "Hungaria"
in Budapest. Then at evening, while the pretty Lola
gossiped with a weedy old Italian Marchioness, whose
acquaintance she had made, her uncle played billiards
with me, and he was no bad player either!</p>

<p>As soon as the Spaniard learnt of my position as
personal-adjutant of His Imperial Highness the Crown-Prince
he became immediately interested, as most
people were, and plied me with all sorts of questions
regarding the truth of certain scandals that were at
the moment afloat concerning "Willie." As you
know, I am usually pretty discreet. Therefore, I
do not think that he learned very much from me.</p>

<p>We were alone in the billiard-room, having a game
after luncheon one day, when a curious conversation
took place.</p>

<p>"Ah, Count! You must have a very intimate
knowledge of life at the Berlin Court," he remarked
quite suddenly, in French.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes. But it is a strenuous life, I assure you," I
declared, laughing.</p>

<p>"The Crown-Prince sometimes goes abroad incognito,"
he said, pausing and looking me straight in
the face.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;sometimes," I admitted.</p>

<p>"He was in Rome in the first week of last December.
He disappeared from Potsdam, and the
Emperor and yourself were extremely anxious as to
what had become of him. He had gone to Berlin
alone, without any attendant, and completely disappeared.
Yet, while you were all making secret
inquiries, and fearing lest the truth should leak out
to the Press, His Imperial Highness was living as
plain Herr Wilhelm Nebelthau in an apartment at
Number Seventeen, Lungtevere Mellini. Isn't that
so?"</p>

<p>I stared agape at the Spaniard.</p>

<p>I thought myself the only person who knew that
fact&mdash;a fact which the Crown-Prince had revealed to
me in the strictest secrecy.</p>

<p>Could this man Martinez Aranda be an agent of
police? Yet that seemed quite impossible.</p>

<p>"You appear to have a more intimate knowledge
of His Highness's movements than I have myself," I
replied, utterly amazed at the extent of the man's
information.</p>

<p>His dark, sallow face relaxed into a mysterious
smile, and he bent to make another stroke without
replying.</p>

<p>"His Highness should be very careful in the concealment
of his movements when he is incognito," he
remarked presently.</p>

<p>"You met him there, eh?" I asked, eager to ascertain
the truth, for that secret visit to Rome had been
a most mysterious one, even to me.</p>

<p>"I do not think I need reply to that question," he
said. "All I can say is that the Crown-Prince kept
rather queer company on that occasion."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>Those words only served to confirm my suspicions.
Whenever "Willie" disappeared alone from Potsdam
I could afterwards always trace the disappearance to
his <i>penchant</i> for the eternal feminine. How often,
indeed, had I been present at scenes between the
Crown-Princess and her husband, and how often I
had heard the Emperor storm at his son in that high-pitched
voice so peculiar to the Hohenzollerns when
unduly excited.</p>

<p>The subject soon dropped, but his statements filled
me with apprehension. It was quite plain that this
well-dressed, bald-headed Spaniard was in possession
of some secret of the Crown-Prince's, a secret which
had not been revealed to me.</p>

<p>More than once in the course of the next few days,
when we were alone together, I endeavoured to learn
something of the nature of the secret which took his
Highness to the Eternal City, but Aranda was very
clever and discreet. In addition, the attitude of the
girl Lola became more than ever strange. There was
a blank look in those big, beautiful eyes of hers that
betrayed something abnormal. But what it was I
failed to decide.</p>

<p>One evening after dinner I saw her walking alone
in the moonlight along the terrace by the lake, and
joined her. So preoccupied she seemed that she
scarcely replied to my remarks. Then suddenly she
halted, and as though unable to restrain her feelings
longer I heard a low sob escape her.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle, what is the matter?" I asked in
French. "Tell me."</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing, Monsieur, nothing," she declared
in a low, broken voice. "I&mdash;I know I am very
foolish, only&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Only what? Tell me. That you are in distress
I know. Let me assist you."</p>

<p>She shook her handsome head mournfully.</p>

<p>"No, you cannot assist me," she declared in a
tone that told me how desperate she had now become.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
"My uncle," she exclaimed, staring straight before
her across the moonlit waters, whence the dark
mountains rose from the opposite bank. "Count, be
careful! Do&mdash;my&mdash;my uncle."</p>

<p>"I don't understand," I said, standing at her side
and gazing at her pale countenance beneath the full
light of the moon.</p>

<p>"My uncle&mdash;he knows something&mdash;be careful&mdash;warn
the Crown-Prince."</p>

<p>"What does he know?"</p>

<p>"He has never told me."</p>

<p>"Are you in entire ignorance of the reason of the
visit of His Highness to Rome? Try and remember
all you know," I urged.</p>

<p>The girl put both her palms to her brow, and,
shaking her head, said:</p>

<p>"I can remember nothing&mdash;nothing&mdash;oh! my
poor head! Only warn the man who in Rome
called himself Herr Nebelthau!"</p>

<p>She spoke in a low, nervous tone, and I could see
that she was decidedly hysterical and much unstrung.</p>

<p>"Did you meet Herr Nebelthau?" I asked eagerly.</p>

<p>"Me? Ah, no. But I saw him, though he never
saw me."</p>

<p>"But what is the secret that your uncle knows?"
I demanded. "If I know, then I can warn the Crown-Prince."</p>

<p>"I do not know," she replied, again shaking her
head. "Only&mdash;only&mdash;well, by some means my
uncle knew that you had left Potsdam, and we
travelled here on purpose to meet you to obtain from
you some facts concerning the Crown-Prince's
movements."</p>

<p>"To meet me?" I echoed in surprise. In a
moment I saw that Aranda's intentions were evidently
evil ones. But just at that juncture the Spaniard
came forth in search of his niece.</p>

<p>"Why are you out here?" he asked her gruffly.
"Go in. It is too cold for you."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>"I came out with the Count to see the glorious
panorama of the lake," explained the girl in strange
humbleness, and then, turning reluctantly, she obeyed
him.</p>

<p>"Come and have a hand at bridge," her uncle
urged cheerfully. "The Signora Montalto and young
Boileau are ready to make up the four."</p>

<p>To this I agreed, and we followed the girl into the
big, white-panelled lounge of the hotel.</p>

<p>Two days later, about four o'clock in the afternoon,
Aranda received a telegram, and an hour later left
with his niece, who, as she parted from me, whispered:</p>

<p>"Warn the Crown-Prince, won't you?"</p>

<p>I promised, and as they drove off to the station I
stood waving my hand to the departing visitors.</p>

<p>A week later I had word from Cuxhaven of the
arrival of the <i>Hohenzollern</i> from Trondhjem, and at
once returned to the Marmor Palace, where on the
night of my arrival the Crown-Prince, wearing his
Saxon Uhlan uniform, entered my room, gaily
exclaiming:</p>

<p>"Well, Heltzendorff, how are things on the Lake
of Garda, eh?"</p>

<p>I briefly explained where I had been, and then, as
he lit a cigarette, standing astride near the fireplace,
I asked permission to speak upon a confidential
matter.</p>

<p>"More trouble, eh?" he asked, with a grin and a
shrug of the shoulders.</p>

<p>"I do not know," I said seriously, and then, in
brief, I related how the man Aranda had arrived with
the girl Lola at the hotel, and what had followed.</p>

<p>As soon as I mentioned the Lungtevere Mellini,
that rather aristocratic street, which runs parallel
with the Tiber on the outskirts of Rome, His Highness
started, his face blanched instantly, and he bit
his thin lip.</p>

<p>"<i>Himmel!</i>" he gasped. "The fellow knows that
I took the name of Nebelthau! Impossible!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>"But he does," I said quietly. "He is undoubtedly
in possession of some secret concerning
your visit to Rome last December."</p>

<p>In His Highness's eyes I noticed a keen, desperate
expression which I had scarcely ever seen there
before.</p>

<p>"You are quite certain of this, Heltzendorff,
eh?" he asked. "The man's name is Martinez
Aranda?"</p>

<p>"Yes. He says he is from Seville. His niece,
Lola Serrano, told me to warn you that he means
mischief."</p>

<p>"Who is the girl? Do I know her?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Why does she warn me?"</p>

<p>"I cannot say," was my reply. "As you are
aware, I have no knowledge of the nature of Your
Highness's visit to Rome. I merely report all that
I could gather from the pair, who evidently went to
Gardone to meet me."</p>

<p>"Where are they now?"</p>

<p>"In Paris&mdash;at the Hotel Terminus, Gare St. Lazare.
I found out that they had taken tickets to Verona
and thence to Paris, therefore I telegraphed to my
friend Pinaud, of the S√ªret√©, who quickly found them
and reported to me by wire within twenty-four hours."</p>

<p>"H'm! This is serious, Heltzendorff&mdash;infernally
serious," declared the Crown-Prince, with knit brows,
as he commenced to pace the room with his hands
clasped behind his back.</p>

<p>Suddenly he halted in front of me and smoothed
his hair&mdash;a habit of his when perplexed.</p>

<p>"First, the Emperor must know nothing, and the
Crown-Princess must be kept in entire ignorance at
all costs," he declared. "I can now foresee a great
amount of trouble. Curse the women! I trusted
one, and she&mdash;ah! I can see it all now."</p>

<p>"Is it very serious?" I asked, still anxious to
glean the truth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>"Serious!" he cried, staring at me wildly.
"Serious! Why, Heltzendorff, it means everything
to me&mdash;everything!"</p>

<p>The Crown-Prince was not the kind of man to
exhibit fear. Though degenerate in every sense of
the word, and without the slightest idea of moral
obligations, yet he was, nevertheless, utterly oblivious
to danger of any sort, being wildly reckless, with an
entire disregard of consequences. Here, however,
he saw that the secret, which he had fondly believed
to be his alone, was known to this mysterious
Spaniard.</p>

<p>"I cannot understand why this girl, Lola&mdash;or
whatever she calls herself&mdash;should warn me. I
wonder who she is. What is she like?"</p>

<p>I described her as minutely as I could, more
especially the unusual fairness of her hair, and the
large, wide-open, blue eyes. She had a tiny mole
upon her chin, a little to the left.</p>

<p>The description seemed to recall some memory, for
suddenly he exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Really, the girl you describe is very like one that
I met about a year ago&mdash;a thief-girl in the Montmartre,
in Paris, called Lizette Sabin. I came across
her one night in one of the cabarets."</p>

<p>As he spoke he went across to a big antique chest of
drawers, one of which he unlocked with his key, and
after a long search he drew out a cabinet photograph
and handed it to me.</p>

<p>I started. It was a picture of the pretty Lola!</p>

<p>He watched my face, and saw that I recognized
it.</p>

<p>Then he drew a long sigh, tossed his cigarette away
savagely, and throwing back the photograph into the
drawer, relocked it.</p>

<p>"Yes," he declared, turning to me again. "The
situation is most abnormally disturbing, Heltzendorff.
A storm is brewing, without a doubt. But
the Emperor must know nothing, remember&mdash;not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
the slightest suspicion. Ah! What an infernal fool
I was to believe in that woman. Bah! They are
all alike. And yet&mdash;&mdash;" and he paused&mdash;"and yet
if it were not for the petticoat Germany's secret
diplomacy&mdash;the preparation for the great 'Day'
when we shall stagger the world&mdash;could not proceed.
This, my dear Heltzendorff, has shown me that you
may with advantage use a woman of whatever age
as your catspaw, your secret agent, your bait when
angling for important information, or your go-between
in secret transactions; but never trust one
with knowledge of your own personal affairs."</p>

<p>"Then I take it that this girl-thief of the Montmartre
whom you met when out for an evening's
amusement is the cause of all this trouble? And
yet she said that she did not know you!"</p>

<p>"Because it was to her advantage to disclaim
knowledge of me. Personally I do not think that
the pretty Lizette is my enemy or she would not
warn me against this infernal Spaniard, whoever he
may be."</p>

<p>"If the matter is so serious, had I not better go
to Paris to-morrow and see Pinaud?" I suggested.</p>

<p>"Excellent!" he exclaimed. "Watch must be
kept upon them. The one thing to bear in mind,
however, is that neither the Emperor nor my wife
learn anything. Go to Paris to-morrow, and tell
Pinaud from me to do his best on my behalf."</p>

<p>Next morning I left for Paris, and on arrival spent
half an hour with Georges Pinaud in his room at the
S√ªret√©.</p>

<p>"So His Imperial Highness does not wish the
arrest of the girl Lizette Sabin?" he exclaimed
presently. "I have her <i>dossier</i> here," and he
indicated a cardboard portfolio before him. "It is
a pretty bad one. Her last sentence was one of
twelve months for robbing an English baronet at a
dancing-hall in the Rue du Bac."</p>

<p>"His Highness does not wish for her arrest. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
only desires the pair to be kept under close
observation."</p>

<p>"The man Aranda is, I have discovered, a
dangerous person," said the famous detective, leaning
back in his chair. "He has served a sentence at
Cayenne for the attempted murder of a woman in
Lyons. He is, of course, an adventurer of the most
expert type."</p>

<p>I longed to reveal to my friend Pinaud the whole
facts, but this was against my instructions. I merely
asked him as a favour to institute a strict vigilance
upon the pair, and to report to me by telegraph if
either of them left Paris.</p>

<p>Aranda was still living at the Hotel Terminus,
but the pretty Lizette had gone to stay with two
girl friends, professional dancers, who lived on the
third floor of a house half-way up the Rue Blanche.
So having discharged my mission, I returned on the
following day to Potsdam, where, on meeting me,
the Crown-Prince seemed much relieved.</p>

<p>His only fear&mdash;and it was a very serious one&mdash;was
that to the Emperor there might be revealed the
reason of that secret visit of his to Italy. I confess
that I myself began to regard that visit with considerable
suspicion. Its nature must have been, to
say the least, unusual if he had been so aghast at the
real truth being discovered.</p>

<p>In the strenuous days that followed, weeks, indeed,
I frequently reflected, and found myself much
mystified. More than once His Highness had asked
me: "Any news from Pinaud?" And when I
replied in the negative "Willie's" relief was at once
apparent.</p>

<p>One day I had been lunching in Berlin at the
"Bristol," in Unter den Linden, at a big party given
by the Baroness von B√ºlow. Among the dozen or
so present were Von Ruxeben, the Grand Marshal of
the Court of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha; Gertrud, Baroness
von Wangenheim, Grand Mistress of the Court of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
Duchess; the Minister Dr. Rasch; and, of course,
old "Uncle" Zeppelin, full of plans, as always, of
new airships and of the destruction of London.
Indeed, he sat next me, and bored me to death with
his assurances that on "The Day" he would in
twenty-four hours lay London in ruins.</p>

<p>The guests around the table, a gay and clever
circle, saw that "Uncle" had button-holed me, and
knew from my face how utterly bored I was. Truth
to tell, I was much relieved when suddenly, when the
meal was nearly over, a waiter whispered that somebody
wished to see me out in the lounge.</p>

<p>It was a messenger from Potsdam with a telegram
that had come over the private wire. It read:
"Aranda left Paris two days ago. Destination
unknown.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Pinaud.</span>"</p>

<p>The information showed that the fellow had
cleverly evaded the agents of the S√ªret√©, a very difficult
feat in such circumstances. That very fact went
to prove that he was a cunning and elusive person.</p>

<p>Half an hour later I was sitting with Heinrich
Wesener, Assistant-Director of the Secret Service of
the General Staff. I sought him in preference to the
famous detective, Schunke, because, while matters
passing through the Secret Service Bureau were
always regarded as confidential, those submitted to
the Berlin police were known to many subordinates
who had access to the <i>dossiers</i> and informations.</p>

<p>I told Wesener but little&mdash;merely that His Imperial
Highness the Crown-Prince was desirous of knowing
at the earliest moment if a Spaniard named Martinez
Aranda should arrive in Berlin.</p>

<p>The curiosity of the Assistant-Director was immediately
aroused. So many scandals were rife regarding
"Willie" that the stout, fair-haired official was
hoping to obtain some further details.</p>

<p>"Excuse me for a moment," he said, and, after
ringing his bell, a clerk appeared. To the man he
gave orders to go across and inspect the police register<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
of strangers, and ascertain if the man Aranda had
arrived in the capital.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later the clerk returned, saying that
a Spaniard named Aranda had arrived from Paris
early that morning with a young lady named Sabin,
and that they were staying at the Central Hotel,
opposite the Friedrich-Strasse Station.</p>

<p>Upon this information I went to the "Central,"
and from the hall-porter discovered that Aranda had
left the hotel an hour before, but that his supposed
niece was upstairs in her room.</p>

<p>Afterwards I hurried back to Potsdam as quickly
as possible, only to find that the Crown-Prince was
out with Knof motoring somewhere. Of the Crown-Princess
I inquired whither he had gone, but, as usual,
she had no idea. "Willie" was ever erratic, and
ever on the move.</p>

<p>Six o'clock had already struck when he returned, and
the sentry informed him that I was extremely anxious
to see him. Therefore, without removing his coat, he
ascended to my room, where he burst in breezily.</p>

<p>When I told him what I had discovered in Berlin
the light died instantly out of his face.</p>

<p>"Is the fellow really here, Heltzendorff?" he
gasped. "I had a letter from him a week ago declaring
his intention to come here."</p>

<p>"You did not reply, I hope?"</p>

<p>"No. The letter I found upon my dressing-table,
but I have not discovered who placed it there," he
said. "The fellow evidently intends to carry out
his threat and expose me to the Emperor."</p>

<p>"What can he expose?" I queried.</p>

<p>But "Willie" was not to be caught like that.
He merely replied:</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;something which must at all hazards be concealed.
How this Spaniard can know I cannot in the
least imagine&mdash;unless that woman gave me away!"</p>

<p>For the next two days I was mostly out with his
Highness in the car, and in addition the Kaiser<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
reviewed the Prussian Guard, a ceremony which
always gave me much extra work.</p>

<p>On the third day I had in the morning been out
to the Wildpark Station, and, passing the sentries,
had re-entered the Palace, when one of the footmen
approached me, saying:</p>

<p>"Pardon, Count, but there is a gentleman to see his
Imperial Highness. He will give no name, and
refuses to leave. I called the captain of the guard,
who has interrogated him, and he has been put into
the blue ante-room until your return."</p>

<p>At that moment I saw the captain of the guard
striding down the corridor towards me.</p>

<p>"A bald-headed man is here to see His Highness,
and will give no name," he told me. "He is waiting
now. Will you see him?"</p>

<p>"No," I said, my suspicions aroused. "I will first
see the Crown-Prince."</p>

<p>After some search I found the latter lolling at
his ease in his own smoking-room in the private
apartments, reading a French novel and consuming
cigarettes.</p>

<p>"Hulloa, Heltzendorff! Well, what's the
trouble?" he asked. "I see something is wrong
from your face."</p>

<p>"The man Aranda is here," I replied.</p>

<p>"Here!" he gasped, starting up and flinging the
book aside. "Who let him in?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, but he is below demanding to
see you."</p>

<p>"Has he made any statement? Has he told
anybody what he knows?" demanded the Crown-Prince,
who at that moment presented what might
be termed a white-livered appearance, cowed, and
even trembling. In his slant eyes showed a look of
undisguised terror, and I realized that the truth,
whatever it might be, was a damning and most
disgraceful one.</p>

<p>"I can't see him, Heltzendorff," he whined to me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
"See him; hear what he has to say&mdash;and&mdash;and you
will keep my secret? Promise me."</p>

<p>I promised. And I should have kept that promise
were it not for his brutal and blackguardly acts after
the outbreak of war&mdash;acts which placed him, with his
Imperial father, beyond the pale of respectable
society.</p>

<p>I was turning to leave the room, when he sprang
towards me with that quick agility of his, and, placing
his white, manicured hand upon my arm, said:</p>

<p>"Whatever he may say you will not believe&mdash;will
you?"</p>

<p>"And if he wants money?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Ascertain the amount, and come here to me."</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour later Martinez Aranda sat in
my room opposite my table. I had told him that
unfortunately His Imperial Highness was engaged,
for the Emperor had come over from the Neues
Palace for luncheon. Then I inquired the nature of
his business.</p>

<p>"Well, Count, you and I are not altogether strangers,
are we?" was his reply, as he sat back calmly
and crossed his legs, perfectly at his ease. "But my
business is only with His Highness, and with nobody
else."</p>

<p>"His Highness sees nobody upon business. I am
appointed to deal with all his business affairs, and
anything told to me is the same as though spoken
into his ear."</p>

<p>The Spaniard from Montmartre was silent for a
moment.</p>

<p>"If that is the case, then I would be glad if you will
obtain his permission for me to speak. He will
remember my name."</p>

<p>"I already received orders before I invited you up,"
I said. "His Highness wishes you to deal with me.
He knows that you are here to settle some delicate
little piece of business concerning that secret visit
of his to Rome&mdash;eh?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," he answered, after a few seconds' pause.
"I am well aware, Count, that for mention of the
reason I am here you might call the guard to arrest
me for blackmail. But first let me assure His Highness
that such action would not be advisable in the
interests of either himself or of the Emperor. I have
already made arrangements for exposure in case His
Highness endeavours to close my mouth by such
means."</p>

<p>"Good. We understand each other. What is
your complaint?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"I know the truth concerning the mysterious
death of the woman, Claudia Ferrona, in Rome last
December," he said briefly.</p>

<p>"Oh!" I exclaimed. "Perhaps you will tell me
next that the Crown-Prince is an assassin? Come,
that will be really interesting," I laughed. "Perhaps
you will tell me how it all happened&mdash;the extent of
your knowledge."</p>

<p>"Why should I do that? Go to the Crown-Prince
and tell him what I allege&mdash;tell him that the girl,
Lizette Sabin, whom he knows, was a witness."</p>

<p>"Well, let us come to business," I said. "How
much do you want for your silence?"</p>

<p>"I want nothing&mdash;not a sou!" was the hard reply.
"All I want is to reveal to the Emperor that his son
is responsible for a woman's death. And that is
what I intend doing. You hear that! Well, Count
von Heltzendorff, please go and tell him so."</p>

<p>Quickly realizing the extreme gravity of the
situation, I returned to the Crown-Prince and told
him the startling allegation made against him.</p>

<p>His face went as white as paper.</p>

<p>"We must pay the fellow off. Close his mouth
somehow. Help me, Heltzendorff," he implored.
"What can I do? He must not reveal the truth to
the Emperor!"</p>

<p>"Then it really is the truth!" I exclaimed,
astounded.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>The Crown-Prince hung his head, and in a low,
hoarse voice replied:</p>

<p>"It is my accursed luck! The woman must have
told the truth to this scoundrel of a Spaniard before&mdash;before
she died!"</p>

<p>"And Lizette?" I asked. "She is a witness,
the fellow says."</p>

<p>"No, no!" cried His Highness wildly, covering
his white face with his hands as though to hide the
guilt written upon his countenance. "Say no more!
Ask the fellow's price, and pay him. We must not
allow him to go to the Emperor."</p>

<p>Three minutes later I went back to my room, but
it was empty. The Spaniard had walked out, and
would, no doubt, be wandering somewhere in the
private apartments.</p>

<p>At that instant the telephone rang, and, answering
it, I heard that His Majesty had just arrived by car,
and was on his way up to the room wherein I stood&mdash;the
room in which he generally met his son.</p>

<p>For a moment I was perplexed, but a few seconds
later I held my breath when I saw coming down the
corridor the Emperor, and walking with him the
adventurer, who had apparently met him on his way
downstairs.</p>

<p>I confess that at that most dramatic moment I
was entirely nonplussed. I saw how cleverly Aranda
had timed his visit, and how, by some means, he knew
of the internal arrangements of the Marmor Palace.</p>

<p>"Yes," the Emperor exclaimed to the Spaniard.
"You wish to have audience. Well?"</p>

<p>In a second I broke in.</p>

<p>"May I be permitted to say a word, Your
Majesty?" I said. "There is a little business matter
pending between this gentleman and His Imperial
Highness the Crown-Prince&mdash;a little dispute over
money. I regret that Your Majesty should be
disturbed by it. The matter is in course of
settlement."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, money matters!" exclaimed the Emperor,
who always hated mention of them, believing himself
to be far too important a person to trouble about
them. "Of course, you will see to a settlement,
Count." And the Emperor turned his back deliberately
upon the man who accosted him.</p>

<p>"It is not money that I want," shouted the
adventurer from Paris, "but I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>I did not allow him to conclude his sentence, but
hustled him into an adjoining room, closing the door
after him.</p>

<p>"Now, Monsieur Aranda, you want money, I
know. How much?" I asked determinedly.</p>

<p>"Two hundred thousand marks," was his prompt
reply, "and also fifty thousand for Lola."</p>

<p>I pretended to reflect. He saw my hesitation, and
then added:</p>

<p>"For that sum, and not a sou less, I am prepared
to sign a statement that I have lied, and that there is
no truth in the allegation."</p>

<p>"Of what? Tell me the facts, as you know
them, and I will then repeat them to His Imperial
Highness."</p>

<p>For a few seconds he was silent, then in a cold,
hard voice he revealed to me what was evidently the
truth of the Crown-Prince's secret visit to Rome. I
listened to his statement utterly dumbfounded.</p>

<p>The allegations were terrible. It seemed that a
popular Spanish variety actress, whom the populace
of Rome knew as "La Bella," but whose real name
was Claudia Ferrona, lived in a pretty apartment on
the Lungtevere Mellini, facing the Tiber. His
Highness had met her in Coblenz, where she had been
singing. "La Bella" had as her particular friend a
certain high official in the Italian Ministry of War,
and through him she was enabled to furnish the Crown-Prince
with certain important information. The
General Staff in the Wilhelmstrasse were eager to
obtain some very definite facts regarding Italy's new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
armaments, and His Highness had taken upon himself
the task of obtaining it.</p>

<p>As Herr Nebelthau he went in secret to Rome as
guest of the vivacious Claudia, whose maid was none
other than the thief-girl of the Montmartre, Lizette
Sabin. This girl, whose intellect had become weakened,
was entirely under the influence of the clever
adventurer Aranda. On the second night after the
arrival of the Crown-Prince in Rome, he and the
actress had taken supper together in her apartment,
after which a fierce quarrel had arisen between
them.</p>

<p>Seized by a fit of remorse, the variety singer blankly
refused to further betray the man to whom her advancement
in her profession was due, whereupon His
Highness grew furious at being thwarted at the last
moment. After listening to his insults, "La Bella"
openly declared that she intended to reveal the whole
truth to the Italian official in question. Then the
Crown-Prince became seized by one of those mad,
frenzied fits of uncontrollable anger to which he is at
times, like all the Hohenzollerns, subject, and with
his innate brutality he took up a bottle from the
table and struck the poor girl heavily upon the skull,
felling her like a log. Afterwards with an imprecation
on his lips, he walked out. So terribly injured
was the girl that she expired just before noon next
day. Not, however, before she had related the whole
circumstances to the maid, Lizette, and to the man
Aranda, who, truth to tell, had placed the maid in
the actress's service with a view of robbing her of her
jewels. He saw, however, that, with the death of
Claudia Ferrona, blackmail would be much more
profitable.</p>

<p>Having heard this amazing story, I was careful to
lock the Spaniard in the room, and then returned to
where the Crown-Prince was so anxiously awaiting me.</p>

<p>Half an hour later the adventurer left the Palace,
bearing in his pocket a draft upon the private banking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
house of Mendelsohn, in the J√§gerstrasse in Berlin, for
two hundred and fifty thousand marks.</p>

<p>In return for that draft the wily Spaniard signed a
declaration that he had invented the whole story, and
that there was not a word of truth in it.</p>

<p>It was only, however, when I placed that document
into the hands of the Crown-Prince that His
Imperial Highness breathed freely again.</p>

<h2><a name="SECRET_NUMBER_NINE" id="SECRET_NUMBER_NINE"></a>SECRET NUMBER NINE</h2>
<h3>THE CROWN-PRINCE'S ESCAPADE IN LONDON</h3>


<p>It was five o'clock on a bright September morning
when His Imperial Highness climbed with
unsteady gait the three flights of stairs leading to
the handsome flat which he sometimes rented in a
big block of buildings half-way along Jermyn Street
when he made secret visits to London.</p>

<p>As his personal-adjutant and keeper of his secrets
I had been awaiting him for hours.</p>

<p>I heard him fumbling with the latch-key, and,
rising, went along the hall and opened the door.</p>

<p>"Hulloa, Heltzendorff!" he exclaimed in a thick,
husky voice. "<i>Himmel!</i> I'm very glad to be
back."</p>

<p>"And I am glad to see Your Highness back," I
said. "I was beginning to fear that something
unpleasant had happened. I tell you frankly, I do
not like you going out like this alone in London.
Somebody is certain to discover you one day."</p>

<p>"Oh, bosh! my dear Heltzendorff. You are just
like a pastor&mdash;always preaching." And as he tossed
his crush hat upon the table and divested himself
of his evening overcoat he gave vent to a half-drunken
laugh, and then, just as he was, in his dress-coat
and crumpled shirt-front, with the stains of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
overnight wine upon it, he curled himself upon the
couch, saying:</p>

<p>"Tell that idiot of a valet not to disturb me. I'm
tired."</p>

<p>"But don't you think you ought to go to bed?"
I queried.</p>

<p>"Too tired to undress, Heltzendorff&mdash;too tired,"
he declared with an inane grin. "Oh, I've had a
time&mdash;phew! my head&mdash;such a time! Oh, old Lung
Ching is a real old sport!"</p>

<p>And then he settled himself and closed his eyes&mdash;surely
a fine spectacle for the German nation if he
could then have been publicly exhibited.</p>

<p>His mention of Lung Ching caused me to hold my
breath. That wily Chinaman kept an establishment
in the underworld of Limehouse, an opium den of
the worst description, frequented by yellow men and
white women of the most debased class.</p>

<p>A year before one of the Crown-Prince's friends,
an attach√© at the Embassy on Carlton House Terrace,
had introduced him to the place. The fascinations
of the opium pipe had attracted him, and he had been
there many times to smoke and to dream, but always
accompanied by others. The night before, however,
he had declared his intention to go out alone, as he
had been invited to dine by a great German financier
living in Park Lane. It was now evident, however,
that he had not been there, but had gone alone to
that terrible den kept by Lung Ching.</p>

<p>There, in the grey light of dawn, I stood gazing
down upon the be-drugged son of the Emperor,
feeling relief that he was back again, and that no
trouble had resulted from his escapade.</p>

<p>I called the valet, and, having handed his master
over to him, I went out, and, finding a taxi, drove
out to Lung Ching's place in Limehouse. I knew
the sign, and was soon admitted into the close,
sickly-smelling place, which reeked with opium.
The villainous Chinaman, with a face like parchment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
came forward, and instantly recognized me as
the companion of the young German millionaire,
Herr Lehnhardt. Of him I inquired what my master
had been doing during the night.</p>

<p>"Oh, 'e smoke&mdash;'e likee pipee!" was the evil,
yellow-faced ruffian's reply.</p>

<p>"Was he alone?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no. 'E no alonee. 'E lil ladee," and he
grinned. "She likee pipee. Come, you see&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>The fellow took me into the long, low-ceilinged
room, fitted with bunks, in which were a dozen or so
sleeping Chinamen. Suddenly he indicated a bunk
wherein lay a girl huddled up&mdash;a well-dressed English
girl. Her hat and jacket had been removed, and
she lay, her face full in the light, her arm above her
head, her eyes closed in sound slumber, with the
deadly pipe beside her.</p>

<p>I bent to examine her pale countenance more
closely. I started. Yes! I had not been mistaken.
She was the young daughter of one of the best-known
and most popular leaders of London society.</p>

<p>I had no idea until that moment that she and the
Crown-Prince were such friends. A fortnight before
the Crown-Prince, as Herr Lehnhardt, had attended
a gay river party at Henley, and I had accompanied
him. At the party the pair had been introduced in
my presence. And now, within those few days, I
found her oblivious to the world in the worst opium
den in London!</p>

<p>After considerable effort, I aroused her. But she
was still dazed from the effect of the drug, so dazed,
indeed, that she did not recognize me. However,
I got her into a taxi, and having ascertained her
mother's address from the "Royal Blue Book" in
the London club of which I was a member, and
where I arrived at an unearthly hour, I took her to
Upper Brocklion Street.</p>

<p>Of the woman who opened the door I learned, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
my relief, that the family were at their place in Scotland,
and that the house, enshrouded in dust-sheets,
was in the hands of herself and her husband as
caretakers.</p>

<p>When I half lifted the young lady&mdash;whom I will
here call Miss Violet Hewitt for the sake of the good
name of her family&mdash;out of the taxi the woman
became greatly alarmed. But I assured her there
was nothing wrong; her young mistress had been
taken ill, but was now much better. A doctor was
not needed.</p>

<p>For half an hour I remained there with her, and
then, as she had recovered sufficiently, I rose to go,
intending to let her make her own explanations to
the caretaker.</p>

<p>We were alone, and she was seated in a big arm-chair.
She saw my intention to leave, whereupon
she struggled to her feet, for she now realized to her
horror what had occurred.</p>

<p>"You are Count von Heltzendorff!" she exclaimed,
passing her hand across her brow, as though suddenly
recollecting. "We met at Henley. Ah! I
know I&mdash;I can't help it. I have been very foolish&mdash;but
I can't help it. The craving grows upon
me."</p>

<p>"You met my friend Lehnhardt last night, did
you not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I did. Quite accidentally. I was waiting
in the lounge of the 'Ritz' for a man-friend with
whom I had promised to dine when Mr. Lehnhardt
came in and recognized me. My friend had not
turned up, so I accepted his invitation to have
dinner at Claridge's. This we did, and during the
meal he spoke of opium, and I admitted that I was
fond of it, for I smoke it sometimes at a girl-friend's
at Hampstead. Therefore we agreed to go together
to Lung Ching's."</p>

<p>"He left you there," I said.</p>

<p>"I know. I certainly did not expect him to go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
away and leave me in such a place," said the girl,
who was very pretty and not more than twenty,
even though addicted to the terrible opium habit.
"But," she added, "you will keep my secret&mdash;won't
you?"</p>

<p>"Most certainly, Miss Hewitt," was my reply.
"This should serve as a severe lesson to you."</p>

<p>Then I bade her farewell, and left her in the good
hands of the caretaker.</p>

<p>On my return to Jermyn Street the Crown-Prince
was in bed, sleeping soundly.</p>

<p>I remember standing at the window of that well-furnished
bachelor's sitting-room&mdash;for the place
was owned by an old German-American merchant,
who, I expect, had a shrewd suspicion of the identity
of the reckless young fellow named Lehnhardt who
sometimes, through a well-known firm of house-agents,
rented his quarters at a high figure. The
Crown-Prince used eight different names when abroad
incognito, Lehnhardt being one of them.</p>

<p>"His Highness is very tired," the valet declared
to me, as he entered the room. "Before I got him
to bed he asked for you. I said you had gone
out."</p>

<p>"And what did he say?"</p>

<p>"Well, Count, all he said was, 'Ah, our dear Heltzendorff
is always an early riser. He gets up before
I go to bed!'" And the ever-faithful valet
laughed grimly. When the Crown-Prince went
upon those frequent debauches in the capitals of
Europe, his valet always carried with him a certain
drug, a secret known to the Chinese, an injection of
which at once sobered him, and put both sense and
dignity into him. I have seen him in the most
extreme state of helpless intoxication at five in the
morning, and yet at eight, he having received his
injection, I have watched him mount his horse and
ride at the head of his regiment to an inspection, as
bright and level-headed as any trooper following.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>The drug had a marvellous and almost instantaneous
effect. But it was used only in case of great
emergency, when, for instance, he was suddenly
summoned by the Emperor, or perchance he had
to accompany his wife to some public function.</p>

<p>That the drug had bad effects I knew quite well.
I have often seen him pacing the room holding his
hands to his head, when, three hours later, the dope
was gradually losing its potency, leaving him inert
and ill.</p>

<p>When the valet had retired, I stood gazing down
into the growing life of Jermyn Street, deploring the
state of society which had resulted in the pretty
Violet Hewitt becoming, at twenty, a victim to
opium.</p>

<p>Truly in the world of London, as in Berlin, there
are many strange phases of life, and even I, familiar
as I was with the gaieties of the capitals, and the
night life of Berlin, the Montmartre in Paris, and
the West End in London, here confess that when I
discovered the pretty girl sleeping in that dirty bunk
in that fetid atmosphere I was staggered.</p>

<p>Before three o'clock in the afternoon "Willie" reappeared,
well groomed and perfectly dressed. I had
been out lunching at the "Berkeley" with a friend,
and on re-entering the chambers, found him in the
sitting-room smoking a cigarette.</p>

<p>The effects of his overnight dissipation had entirely
passed. He seated himself upon the arm of a chair
and asked:</p>

<p>"Well, Heltzendorff, I suppose you've been out
to lunch&mdash;eh? Anything interesting in this town?"</p>

<p>"The usual set at the 'Berkeley,'" I replied.</p>

<p>"Oh! The 'Berkeley!' Very nice, but too
respectable. That is where one takes one's aunt,
is it not?" he laughed.</p>

<p>I admitted that it was a most excellent restaurant.</p>

<p>"Good food and good amusement, my dear Heltzendorff,
one can never find together. The worse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
the food the better the entertainment. Do you
remember the 'Rat Mort'&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"No," I said sharply. "That is a long-past and
unwelcome memory."</p>

<p>The Imperial profligate laughed heartily.</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear Heltzendorff, you are becoming
quite pharisaical. You! Oh! that is really
amusing!"</p>

<p>"The 'Rat Mort' never amused me," I said, "a
caf√© of the Montmartre where those who dined
were&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>I did not finish my sentence.</p>

<p>"Were very pretty and interesting women, Heltzendorff,"
he declared. "Ah! don't you recollect
when you and I dined there not long ago, all
of us at a long table&mdash;so many charming ladies&mdash;oh!"</p>

<p>"I have forgotten it, Prince," I said, rebuking
him. "It has passed from my memory. That place
is just as unfitted for you as is Lung Ching's."</p>

<p>"Lung Ching's! Ah&mdash;yes, the old yellow fellow
is a good sort," he exclaimed, as though recollecting.</p>

<p>"And the lady you took there&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"The lady?" he echoed. "Why, <i>Gott!</i> I left
her there. I did not remember. <i>Gott!</i> I left little
Miss Violet in that place!" he gasped.</p>

<p>"Well?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Well, what can I do. I must go and see."</p>

<p>I smiled, and then told him what I had done.</p>

<p>"H'm," he exclaimed. "You are always a good
diplomat, Heltzendorff&mdash;always a good friend of
the erratic Hohenzollerns. What can I do to-night&mdash;eh?
Suggest something."</p>

<p>"I would suggest that you dined <i>en famille</i> at the
Embassy," I replied.</p>

<p>"The Embassy! Never. I'm sick and tired of
His Excellency and his hideous old wife. They bore
me to death. No, my dear Heltzendorff. I
wonder&mdash;&mdash;"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>And he paused.</p>

<p>"Well?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I wonder if Miss Hewitt would go to the theatre
to-night&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"No," I snapped, for my long service gave me permission
to speak my mind pretty freely. "She is,
I admit, a very charming young lady, but remember
she does not know your identity, and if her parents
discover what happened last night there will be a
most infernal lot of trouble. Recollect that her
father, a financial magnate, is acquainted with the
Emperor. They have raced their yachts against
each other. Indeed, Henry Hewitt's won the Kiel
Cup last year. So, personally, I think the game
that your Imperial Highness is playing is a distinctly
dangerous one."</p>

<p>"Bah! It is only amusement. She amuses me.
And she is so fond of the pipe. She has been a visitor
of Lung Ching's for over a year. She has a faithful
maid who goes with her, and I suppose she pays
the old Chinaman well."</p>

<p>"I suppose so," I remarked, for I knew that if the
villainous old Ching were paid well he would
guarantee her safety in that den of his.</p>

<p>I could see by the Crown-Prince's face that he
was unimpressed by my warning. Too well did I
know to what mad, impetuous lengths he would go
when of a sudden a pretty face attracted him. So
utterly devoid is he of self-control that a woman's
eyes could lead him anywhere. A glance at that
weak chin of his will at once substantiate my
statement.</p>

<p>His visit to Lung Ching's had left him somewhat
muddled and limp, and the next few days passed
uneventfully. We went down into Surrey to stay
with a certain Baron von Rechberg, who had been a
fellow-student of His Highness's at Bonn. He was
now head of a German bank in London, and lived in
a beautiful house surrounded by a large park high<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
among the Surrey hills. Count von Hochberg,
"Willie's" bosom friend, whom he always addressed
as "Mickie," while the Count in turn called him
"C√¶sar," being in London at the time, accompanied
us, and so merrily did the time pass that the incident
at Lung Ching's went out of my memory.</p>

<p>One night when we had all three returned to
London "Willie" and Von Hochberg spent the evening
in the lounge of the Empire Theatre, and both
returned to the Prince's rooms about one o'clock in
the morning.</p>

<p>"Heltzendorff, Mickie is going with me to Scotland
to-morrow morning," said His Highness, as he
tossed his overcoat upon the couch of that luxurious
little sitting-room within sight of the Maison Jules.
"You will stay here and attend to anything that may
come through from Potsdam. A courier should
arrive to-morrow night, or is it Knof who is coming?
I forget."</p>

<p>"Your Highness sent Knof over to get the correspondence,"
I reminded him, for it was necessary that
all pressing matters should be attended to, or the
Emperor's suspicions might be aroused that his son
was absent abroad.</p>

<p>"Ah, the good Knof! Of course, he will be back
to-morrow night. He will have seen the Princess and
told her how ill I have been, and how I am gradually
growing better," he laughed. "Trust Knof to tell
a good, sound lie."</p>

<p>"All chauffeurs can do that, my dear C√¶sar,"
exclaimed Von Hochberg, with a grin.</p>

<p>Naturally I was filled with wonder regarding the
nature of the expedition which the pair were about
to undertake, but, though we all three smoked
together for an hour, "Willie" seemed unusually
sober, and did not let drop a single hint regarding
their mysterious destination.</p>

<p>Von Hochberg was living at the Coburg Hotel, and
before he left "Willie" arranged to breakfast with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
him at eight o'clock next morning, so that they might
leave Euston together by the ten o'clock express.</p>

<p>I roused the valet, who worked for an hour packing
His Highness's suit-case.</p>

<p>"One case only," the Crown-Prince had ordered.
"I shall only be up there a couple or three days.
No evening clothes. I shall not want them."</p>

<p>That remark told me that he did not intend to pay
any formal visit, as he had done on most of his
journeys to Scotland.</p>

<p>"Your Imperial Highness will take guns, of
course," I remarked.</p>

<p>"Guns!" he echoed. "No&mdash;no guns this time.
If I want to shoot rabbits I can borrow a farmer's
blunderbuss," he laughed.</p>

<p>That "Mickie," the hare-brained seeker after
pleasure, was to be his companion caused me some
uneasiness. It was all very well for the Crown-Prince
to live in London as Herr Lehnhardt. London was
a big place, and those who catered for his Imperial
pleasures were paid well, and did not seek to inquire
into his antecedents or whether he was really what
he represented himself to be.</p>

<p>Money talks in the underground London, just as it
does on the Stock Exchange. But it sometimes, I
assure you, took a long purse to keep the foreign
papers quiet regarding the wild escapades of the
Kaiser's heir.</p>

<p>That night somehow I felt a good deal of apprehension
regarding this mysterious flying visit to
Scotland. That the pair had some deeply-laid
scheme on hand I knew from their evasiveness. But
what it was I failed to discover.</p>

<p>Early that morning I put "C√¶sar" into a taxi with
his suit-case. He wore a rough suit of tweeds, and
took with him his walking-stick and a khaki-coloured
waterproof coat, presenting the picture of a young
man going North to shoot.</p>

<p>"I'll be back in a few days, Heltzendorff. Attend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
to the letters," he urged. "Throw away as many
as you can. If I want you I will telegraph."</p>

<p>And with that he drove to the "Coburg" to meet
his old chum, "Mickie."</p>

<p>About three o'clock that same afternoon, while
walking along Piccadilly, I was surprised to come
face to face with Von Hochberg.</p>

<p>"Why! I thought you had gone North!" I
exclaimed.</p>

<p>"No, Heltzendorff. C√¶sar went alone," he replied,
somewhat confounded at our unexpected meeting.
"He wanted to be alone, I think."</p>

<p>"Where has he gone?" I inquired. "He left me
no address."</p>

<p>"No. And I have none either," the Count replied.</p>

<p>This set me thinking. The situation was even
worse with the Crown-Prince wandering in Scotland
alone. His indiscretions were such that his identity
might very easily leak out, and the truth concerning
his absence would quickly reach the Emperor's
ears.</p>

<p>As I stood chatting with His Highness's gay companion
I confess that I felt annoyed at the manner
in which I had been tricked. He was often afraid of
my caustic tongue when I spoke of his indiscretions,
and it was further quite plain to me that Von Hochberg
had simply pretended that he was accompanying
his friend North.</p>

<p>That evening Knof arrived from Potsdam with a
satchelful of correspondence, and until a late hour I
was kept busy inventing replies which would eventually
be taken to Holzemme, in the Harz Mountains,
and posted from there. We always made arrangements
for such things when His Highness was secretly
out of Germany.</p>

<p>I snatched a meal at Jules', close by, and
resumed my work till long after midnight, inventing
some picturesque fictions in reply to many official
documents.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>One letter was from Her Imperial Highness. At
her husband's order I opened it, read it, and sealed it
up again. It contained reproaches, but nothing of
extreme urgency. There had been occasions when I
had read "Cilli's" letters in the absence of her
erratic husband, and sent to her little untruths by
wire, signed "Wilhelm, Kronprinz."</p>

<p>Truly my position was one of curious intimacy.
Sometimes His Highness trusted me with his innermost
secrets, while at others he regarded me with
distinct suspicion. That the elegant Von Hochberg
knew of "Willie's" whereabouts I felt convinced, but
apparently His Highness had given him orders not
to divulge it to me.</p>

<p>The next day and the next I waited in vain for
some word from His Highness. I had sent Knof
back to the Harz to post the replies I had written,
and with nothing to do I idled about London.</p>

<p>On the third day, when I returned to Jermyn
Street after lunch, I found a stout German, named
Henkel, who carried on a hairdresser's business near
High Street, Kensington, but who was really a secret
agent. He was one of the few persons who knew of
the Crown-Prince's visit, for each time we came to
London we took this man into our confidence.</p>

<p>"I have received a telegram from Holzemme,
Count," he said as I entered, and then he handed me
the message, which, after a few minutes' examination&mdash;for
though in plain language it was nevertheless
not what it purported to be&mdash;I saw to my dismay
was an important message to "Willie" from the
Emperor, who was at that moment in Corfu.</p>

<p>The message had been received by Koch, my assistant,
whom I had left at Holzemme. He had disguised
it and re-transmitted it to Henkel to hand to
me. We always took this precaution, because when
abroad incognito, both the Crown-Prince and myself
frequently changed our names. So, by employing
Henkel in London and a man named Behm in Paris,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
we were always certain of receiving any important
message.</p>

<p>When the spy Henkel had left I stood looking out
of the window down into Jermyn Street, quite at a
loss how to act. The message was one of the greatest
importance, and, if not replied to at once, the Emperor
would, I knew, institute inquiries, for he was well
aware of his son's wild escapades.</p>

<p>My first impulse was to wire Koch a reply to be
dispatched to His Majesty, but on reflection I realized
that the question was one which I could not answer
with truth. No. I must find His Highness at all
hazards.</p>

<p>At once I went to the Coburg Hotel, and fortunately
found Count von Hochberg, who at first refused to
reveal where his friend was hidden. But when I
showed him the telegram and explained the great
urgency of a reply, in order to prevent the Emperor
from inquiring and knowing the truth, he realized the
necessity.</p>

<p>"Well, Heltzendorff," he said, somewhat reluctantly,
"C√¶sar is at some little place they call
St. Fillans, in Scotland."</p>

<p>"I know it," I cried eagerly. "A place at the end
of Loch Earn! We motored past it one day about
two years ago. I shall go North at once."</p>

<p>"But you can telegraph to him," the Count
suggested.</p>

<p>"To what address?"</p>

<p>"Ah! Why, of course, I don't know his address&mdash;only
that he is at St. Fillans. I had a note
yesterday."</p>

<p>Travelling by way of Perth and Gleneagles, I next
morning found myself strolling along the picturesque
village at the end of the beautiful loch, which presented
a truly delightful picture in the autumn sunlight.
At the hotel nothing was known of Mr. Lehnhardt,
and though I devoted the whole morning to
making inquiries I could find no trace of His Highness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
The latter would certainly not betray himself as a
German, for, speaking English so well, he might very
easily adopt an English name. I ate my lunch at
the hotel which faces the loch, with Ben Voirlich
rising high beyond, and afterwards resumed my
wanderings. In many quarters I described my
"friend" of whom I was in search, but nobody
seemed to have seen him. The precious hours were
flying, and I knew that the Emperor at Corfu was
impatiently awaiting a reply.</p>

<p>I hired a car and drove seven miles to the farther
end of the loch, to the village of Lochearnhead.
There I made inquiry at the hotel and elsewhere,
afterwards going on to Balquidder with similar
result. It was past six o'clock when I returned to
St. Fillans with the feeling that His Highness had
deceived even his friend "Mickie," and that I had
had my long journey and quest for nothing. Not a
soul seemed to have seen anybody answering to
"Willie's" description. I snatched another hasty
meal at the hotel, and then, in the dusk, set off in
the opposite direction along the pretty road which
led to Comrie. The light was fast fading, but I knew
that there would be a full moon, and the night was
perfect.</p>

<p>I had walked about three miles, and had probably
lost my way, for I was off the main road, when, on
my left, saw the lighted windows of a comfortable-looking
cottage standing back from the road behind
a well-kept flower garden. There were woods on
each side of the road, and I concluded that it was
a keeper's house. As I passed I heard voices, and
saw two figures standing at the garden gate&mdash;a man
and a woman&mdash;chatting confidentially.</p>

<p>In the next second I recognized the man's voice
as that of the Crown-Prince, and as quickly I stepped
upon the grass so that they might not be attracted
by my footsteps. Concealed by the shadow of the
hedge on the opposite side of the road, I stealthily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
approached until I could distinguish, by the light
from the open door of the cottage, that the woman
was a stout, elderly person, probably the keeper's
wife.</p>

<p>Both surprised and interested, I stood there watching.
It seemed as though they were awaiting someone,
for after a few moments, they both retired inside
the cottage.</p>

<p>Presently, however, "Willie" emerged alone. He
had on his hat and carried a stick, and as he swung
through the gate and went forward he whistled softly
to himself the air of a gay waltz of which he was
particularly fond.</p>

<p>Within myself I chuckled at being thus able to
watch his mysterious movements, for he seemed
entirely preoccupied and quite unconscious of being
followed, though I fear my footsteps fell heavily at
times.</p>

<p>Suddenly, while passing along a part of the road
overshadowed by woods on either side, he halted in
the darkness. I heard him speak, and I also heard
the welcome he received in a girl's voice. It was as
I had surmised, and I drew a long breath.</p>

<p>I heard the pair talking, but from where I stood I
could not overhear any of their conversation. I
heard His Highness laugh gaily, and though he lit a
cigarette his companion's face was turned from me
so that I could not catch a glimpse of it in the fitful
light.</p>

<p>Presently, after he had held her in his arms and
kissed her, they turned back in my direction.</p>

<p>As they passed I heard the girl say:</p>

<p>"I've been waiting for quite a quarter of an
hour, Mr. Lehnhardt. I thought perhaps something
had prevented you from keeping the appointment."</p>

<p>"All my mistake, dear," was his reply. "My
mistake. Forgive me."</p>

<p>"Of course," she said, laughing, and I saw that she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
had her arm linked in his as they walked back in the
direction of the keeper's cottage.</p>

<p>I followed in wonder, and not without anger.
For the Heir of the Hohenzollerns to ramble upon
such rural escapades was, I knew, distinctly dangerous.
Exposure might come at any moment.</p>

<p>They had strolled together nearly half a mile
when of a sudden, as they again passed into the deep
shadows, the girl gave vent to a loud scream for help,
and at the same moment men's angry voices were
heard.</p>

<p>The pair had been attacked by three men who had
apparently been lying hidden in the wood.</p>

<p>I heard a man shout, and then a sharp crack like
that of a whip. The Kaiser's son was shouting, too,
while the girl was screaming and crying shame upon
those who had attacked the man with whom she had
been walking.</p>

<p>"You infernal German!" I heard one of the men
shriek. "I'll teach you to come sneaking here and
take my sister out for midnight walks! Take that&mdash;you
cur&mdash;and that!&mdash;whoever you are!"</p>

<p>Next second the startling truth was plain to me.</p>

<p>His Imperial Highness the German Crown-Prince
was being ignominiously and soundly thrashed by an
irate brother!</p>

<p>I saw that it was high time that I interfered. The
Crown-Prince had been flung upon the ground, and
the angry young man was lashing him as I dashed in
among them with my revolver drawn.</p>

<p>"Come, cease that," I shouted. "Down with
that whip. You've attacked these people on the
high road, and if you strike again I'll fire."</p>

<p>"Hulloa!" cried one man. "Why, here's another
German!"</p>

<p>"German or not&mdash;enough!" I commanded, and
bending down, assisted the fallen Prince to rise.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you shall pay for this, I swear!" declared
"Willie," angrily facing the man who had struck him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
Then, turning to me, he apparently recognized my
voice, for he asked&mdash;"How in the name of Fate did
you come here, Heltzendorff?"</p>

<p>"I will explain later," I replied in German. "Let
us get out of this."</p>

<p>"But I cannot leave Violet. I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He had replied in the same language, which the
men apparently did not understand.</p>

<p>"Enough; come," I said. Then in English I
added, "We will wish these gentlemen good-night."</p>

<p>I took his arm and led him away amid the derisive
laughter of the irate brother and his two friends,
leaving the girl with them.</p>

<p>When we were out of earshot I told him of the
Emperor's telegram, and added:</p>

<p>"That lady was Miss Hewitt, was she not?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Her father's estate is a few miles from
here. She's a perfect little fiend for opium&mdash;got
bitten with the habit when she was travelling with her
married sister in China, and Maggie, her old nurse,
who lives in the cottage we shall pass in a minute, lets
her go there on the quiet and smoke. I have had
two or three pipes there lately," he added merrily.</p>

<p>"<i>Himmel!</i>" I gasped. "How dangerous! She
has no idea of who you are, I hope?"</p>

<p>"Not in the least."</p>

<p>"Good. Let us attend to the Emperor's telegram
at once."</p>

<p>And a quarter of an hour later we were discussing
the Kaiser's inquiry in a clean, comfortable, but out-of-the-way
cottage in which "Willie" had established
himself so as to be near the pretty girl for whom he
had conceived that passing fascination.</p>

<p>Until to-day Violet Hewitt has been entirely ignorant
of the identity of the man who, like herself, was
so addicted to opium. These lines, if they meet
her eye, will reveal to her a curious and, no doubt,
startling truth.</p>

<h2><a name="SECRET_NUMBER_TEN" id="SECRET_NUMBER_TEN"></a>SECRET NUMBER TEN</h2>
<h3>HOW THE KAISER ESCAPED ASSASSINATION</h3>


<p>"The Emperor commands you to audience at
once in the private dining-room," said one
of the Imperial servants, entering the Kaiser's study,
where I was awaiting him.</p>

<p>It was seven o'clock on a cold, cheerless morning,
and I had just arrived at Potsdam from Altona, the
bearer of a message from the Crown-Prince to his
father.</p>

<p>I knew that the Emperor always rose at five, and
that he was breakfasting, as was his habit, alone with
the Empress in that coquettish private dining-room
of the Sovereigns, a room into which no servant is
permitted, Augusta preparing and serving the coffee
with her own hands. It was the one hour which the
All-Highest before the war devoted to domesticity,
when husband and wife could gossip and discuss
matters alone and in secret.</p>

<p>As I passed downstairs to the room, to which
entrance was forbidden even to the Crown-Prince
himself, I naturally wondered why I had been commanded
to audience there.</p>

<p>On tapping upon the mahogany door of the little
private salon the Empress's hard voice gave permission
to enter, whereupon I bowed myself into the cosy little
place, hung with reseda silk and with pictures by
Loncret, Perne and Watteau. Upon one side of the
room was a beautiful buhl cabinet, and at the little
round table placed near the window sat the Imperial
pair.</p>

<p>The Empress was reading a letter, but His Majesty
rose as I entered. He was wearing a grey tweed
suit, a well-worn and, no doubt, easy one, in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
nobody ever saw him, for he always changed into
uniform before he went to his study.</p>

<p>"Have you any knowledge of the contents of the
letter which you have brought from the Crown-Prince?"
he asked me bluntly, and I saw by his eyes
that he seemed somewhat mystified.</p>

<p>I replied in the negative, explaining that I had
been with His Imperial Highness to Kiel, and
afterwards to Altona, where the Crown-Princess
had performed the opening ceremony of a new
dock.</p>

<p>"Where are you going now?" he asked suddenly.
"There are other engagements, I believe?"</p>

<p>"To Thorn. His Imperial Highness inspects the
garrison there on Thursday," I said.</p>

<p>"Ah! of course. I intended to go, but it is
impossible."</p>

<p>Then, after a pause, the Emperor looked me straight
in the face and suddenly said:</p>

<p>"Heltzendorff, have you any knowledge of any
man called Minckwitz?"</p>

<p>I reflected.</p>

<p>"I know Count von Minckwitz, Grand-Master of
the Court of the Duke of Saxe-Altenbourg," was my
reply.</p>

<p>"No. This is a man, Wilhelm Minckwitz, who
poses as a musician."</p>

<p>I shook my head.</p>

<p>"You are quite certain that you have never heard
the name? Try to recollect whether the Crown-Prince
has ever mentioned him in your presence."</p>

<p>I endeavoured to recall the circumstance, for somehow
very gradually I felt a distinct recollection of
having once heard that name before.</p>

<p>"At the moment I fail to recall anything, Your
Majesty," was my answer.</p>

<p>The Emperor knit his brows as though annoyed at
my reply, and then grunted deeply in dissatisfaction.</p>

<p>"Remain here in Potsdam," he said. "Telegraph<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
to the Crown-Prince recalling him at my orders, and I
will cancel the inspection at Thorn. Tell the Crown-Prince
that I wish to see him to-night immediately
upon his return."</p>

<p>Then, noticing for the first time that the Emperor
held a paper in his hand, I realized that by its colour
it was one of those secret reports furnished for the
Kaiser's eye alone&mdash;a report of one of the thousands
of spies of Germany spread everywhere.</p>

<p>Minckwitz! I impressed that name upon my
memory, and, being dismissed, bowed myself out of
the Imperial presence.</p>

<p>Returning to the Marmor Palace I sent a long and
urgent message over the private wire to "Willie" at
Altona, repeating His Majesty's orders, and recalling
him at once. Quite well I knew that such an unusual
message would arouse His Highness's apprehension
that for some offence or other he was about to receive
a paternal castigation. But I could not be explicit,
because I had no knowledge of the reason the Emperor
was cancelling our engagement at Thorn.</p>

<p>At nine o'clock that night the Crown-Prince, gay
in his Hussar uniform, burst into the room wherein I
was attending to the correspondence.</p>

<p>"What in the name of Fate does all this mean,
Heltzendorff?" he demanded. "Why did the
Emperor fail to reply to my message?"</p>

<p>"I delivered it," I said. And then I described what
took place in the Emperor's private dining-room.
When I mentioned the name of Minckwitz the Crown-Prince
started and his cheeks blanched.</p>

<p>"Did he ask you that?" he gasped.</p>

<p>"Yes. I told him the only person I knew of that
name was Count von Minckwitz."</p>

<p>"Ah, that little fat, old Master of the Court. Oh!
The Emperor knows him well enough. It is somebody
else he is referring to."</p>

<p>"Do you know him?" I asked eagerly.</p>

<p>"Me? Why&mdash;why, of course not!" was "Willie's"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
quick reply, in a tone which showed me that he was
not telling the truth.</p>

<p>"His Majesty wishes to see you at once," I urged,
full of wonder.</p>

<p>I could plainly see that His Imperial Highness had
been much upset at mention of the mysterious person
called Minckwitz. What could the Emperor know of
him? Was there some scandal at the root of it all,
some facts which the Crown-Prince feared might be
revealed?</p>

<p>Travel-stained, and without changing his tunic,
"Willie" went to the telephone and ordered Knof to
bring back the car. And in it he drove across to the
Neues Palais to see the Emperor.</p>

<p>I had an important appointment in Berlin that
night, and waited until quite late for "Willie's" return.
As he did not come I left for the capital, and on arrival
at my rooms rang up Wolff's Agency, and gave out a
paragraph to the Press that His Imperial Highness
the Crown-Prince had been compelled to abandon
his journey to Thorn, owing to having contracted a
chill. His wife "Cilli"&mdash;the contraction for Cecilia&mdash;had,
however, gone to visit Princess Henry of
Rohnstock at F√ºrstenstein.</p>

<p>Several weeks went by, and one day we were at the
ancient schloss at Oels, in far Silesia, the great estate
which the Crown-Prince inherited on coming of age.
The castle is a big, prison-like place, surrounded by
wide lands and dense forests, lying between the town
of Breslau and the Polish frontier, a remote, rural
place to which "Willie" loved sometimes to retire with
a few kindred spirits in order to look over the estate
and to shoot.</p>

<p>The guests included old Count von Reisenach,
Court Chamberlain, of the Prince of Schombourg-Lippe,
who was a noted raconteur and bon-vivant,
with Major von Heidk√§mper, of the 4th Bavarian
Light Cavalry, a constant companion of "Willie's,"
and Karl von Pappenheim, a captain of the Prussian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
Guard, who had been educated at Oxford, and who
was so English that it was often difficult for people
from London to believe that he was a Prussian.</p>

<p>Von Pappenheim, a tall, good-looking, fair-moustached
man under thirty, was one of "Willie's" new
friends. He was the son of a great landowner of
Erfurt, and the pair had for the past month been
inseparable. He was a shrewd, keen-eyed man, who
seemed ever on the alert, but, of course, obsessed by
military dignity, and as full of swagger as any
Prussian officer could be. He had a sister, Margarete,
a pretty girl, a year or so his junior, who had been to
the Marmor Palace on one occasion. The Crown-Princess
had received her, but from the fact that she
was not invited a second time I concluded that the
inevitable jealousy had arisen, because in my presence
"Willie" had more than once referred to her
beauty.</p>

<p>I sometimes suspected that "Willie's" sudden and
close friendship with Von Pappenheim had some
connection with his intense admiration of the latter's
sister. I, however, learnt the truth concerning
their intimacy in a curious way while at the Schloss
Oels.</p>

<p>One day I had accompanied the party out after
stag, for, being a fair shot, I frequently snatched a
day's sport. Soon after luncheon, which we took at
a forester's house, we went forth again, and I concealed
myself at a point of vantage, lying behind a
screen of ferns and branches specially constructed
as cover.</p>

<p>I was alone, at some considerable distance from the
others, and had been there waiting for nearly an hour
with my gun in readiness when suddenly I heard the
cracking of dried wood not far away.</p>

<p>Something was moving. I raised my gun in
breathless eagerness.</p>

<p>Next moment, however, I heard the voices of two
men.&mdash;"Willie" and his friend, Von Pappenheim.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
They were approaching me, speaking in low, confidential
tones.</p>

<p>"You quite understand," "Willie" was saying.
"My position is a terrible one. I don't know how
to extricate myself. If I dare reveal the truth then
I know full well what their vengeance will be."</p>

<p>"But, my dear C√¶sar," was Karl von Pappenheim's
reply, for he was on such intimate terms that he called
His Highness by the name Von Hochberg had bestowed
upon him, "is it not your duty to risk all and
tell the truth?" he suggested seriously.</p>

<p>The pair had halted only a few yards from me and
taken cover behind a dead bush which had been cut
down and placed conveniently at the spot, in case
the shooting party were a large one and the screen
behind which I had concealed myself was insufficient.
So near were they that I could hear all that was
said.</p>

<p>"The Emperor would neither believe me nor
forgive me," "Willie" said. "Minckwitz is a clever
devil. He would bring manufactured evidence
which must implicate me."</p>

<p>Minckwitz! That was the name which the
Emperor had uttered, asking me if I knew him!
That incident at the Neues Palais flashed across my
memory. I recollected, too, how, when I had
referred to the circumstance, His Highness had become
pale and agitated. Mention of the name had affected
him curiously.</p>

<p>"But can he bring evidence?" asked his companion.</p>

<p>"Yes, curse him!&mdash;he can!"</p>

<p>"You can refute it, surely?"</p>

<p>"No, I can't. If I could I should make a clean
breast of the whole matter," "Willie" declared.
From the tone of his voice I realized how utterly
bewildered he was.</p>

<p>"But cannot I help you? Cannot I see Minckwitz
and bluff him?" his friend suggested.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>"You don't know him," was the reply. "He holds
me in the hollow of his hand."</p>

<p>"Ah! Then you have been horribly indiscreet&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"I have. I admit I have, Karl; and I do not see
any way out of it."</p>

<p>"But, my dear C√¶sar, think of the danger existing
day by day&mdash;hour by hour!" cried Von Pappenheim.
"Think what there is at stake! That letter you
showed me this morning reveals only too plainly
what is intended."</p>

<p>"It is a letter of defiance, I admit."</p>

<p>"And a catastrophe must inevitably occur if you
do not act."</p>

<p>"But how can I act?" cried the Crown-Prince, in
despair. "Suggest something&mdash;I cannot. If I utter
a syllable Minckwitz will most certainly carry out
his threat against me."</p>

<p>"Contrive to have him arrested upon some charge
or other," Karl suggested.</p>

<p>"If I did he would produce the evidence against
me," declared the Crown-Prince.</p>

<p>A silence then fell between the pair. Suddenly
Karl asked:</p>

<p>"Does Von Heltzendorff know?"</p>

<p>"He knows nothing," was "Willie's" answer. "The
Emperor questioned him, but he was in ignorance of
Minckwitz's existence. He was naturally surprised,
but I did not regard it as judicious to enlighten him."</p>

<p>"He is your confidential adjutant. If I were you
I should tell him the truth. No time should be lost,
remember."</p>

<p>Then, after a few seconds of silence. Von Pappenheim
went on:</p>

<p>"Why, I never thought of it! My sister Margarete
knows Minckwitz. She might perhaps be
useful to us&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes!" cried "Willie," "a woman can frequently
accomplish a thing where a man would fail.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
A most excellent idea. Let us leave the others to
their sport and get back to the schloss and discuss
a line of action&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>And in agreement the pair emerged from their
ambush, and retraced their steps along the path they
had come.</p>

<p>Still greatly puzzled at the nature of the secret
which the Crown-Prince was withholding from me,
I came out of my hiding-place and presently rejoined
the party.</p>

<p>That night we all dined together, as was our habit
when at Oels, but I saw that "Willie" was upset and
nervous, and noticed that he drank his champagne
heavily. On the contrary, Von Pappenheim was
wary and watchful.</p>

<p>Next evening Von Pappenheim's sister Margarete,
fair-haired, <i>petite</i> and rather doll-like, arrived at the
Castle.</p>

<p>During dinner an Imperial courier arrived from
Berlin with a letter from the Emperor, and "Willie"
opened it, read it, and then, excusing himself, left
the table. I rose and followed him, as was my duty,
but when outside the room His Highness sent me
back, saying in a thick, husky voice:</p>

<p>"I shall not want you. Von Heltzendorff; I will
write the reply myself."</p>

<p>On my return the guests were discussing the effect
of the Emperor's message upon their host, Von Pappenheim
being particularly anxious. He said something
in a low voice to his sister, when the latter
became at once thoughtful. Indeed, the remainder
of the meal was a very dull affair, and it was with
relief that we rose and went out into the big ancient
hall, with its vaulted ceiling, where coffee was always
served.</p>

<p>The courier had left on his return journey to the
capital, yet "Willie" did not again reappear. At
eleven o'clock I found him lying in a very advanced
state of intoxication upon the sofa in the room set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
apart for me for my writing. Near him stood an
empty brandy bottle and an empty syphon of soda-water.</p>

<p>I called his faithful valet, and together we half
carried him to his room, where he was undressed
and put to bed. Hardly had I returned to my room
when Von Pappenheim entered in search of his
host.</p>

<p>"His Highness is not well, and has retired to his
room," I said. "He expressed a desire to see nobody
to-night."</p>

<p>Von Pappenheim's face changed.</p>

<p>"Oh!" he cried in despair. "Why did he not see
me and tell me the truth! Precious hours are flying,
and we must act if the situation is to be saved."</p>

<p>"What situation?" I asked, in pretended
ignorance.</p>

<p>"You know nothing, Von Heltzendorff, eh?"
he asked, looking me straight in the face.</p>

<p>"Nothing," was my reply.</p>

<p>"You have no knowledge of the trap into which
the Crown-Prince fell when he was in Paris with you
six months ago, and when he and I first met?"</p>

<p>"A trap! What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Has he told you nothing?"</p>

<p>"Not a syllable."</p>

<p>"Ah! Then I cannot be frank with you until
I obtain His Highness's permission. He told me
that you knew nothing, but I did not believe it.
Knowing well what implicit confidence he places in
you, I believed that you knew the ghastly truth."</p>

<p>"You alarm me," I said. "If the situation is
grave, then I may be able to be of some assistance,
more especially if time is pressing."</p>

<p>He hesitated, but refused to reveal a single fact
before receiving the Crown-Prince's permission.</p>

<p>Into what trap had "Willie" fallen during our last
visit to Paris I could not conceive. His wild orgies
in the Montmartre, his constant absences alone, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
terrible craving for excitement, his wild and reckless
search for pleasure in the lowest haunts of vice, had
ever been a source of anxiety to me. Times without
number had I lifted a warning finger, only to be
derided and ridiculed by the son of the All-Highest
One.</p>

<p>Next day, soon after His Highness was dressed, he
entered my room.</p>

<p>"Heltzendorff," he said, "I have been chatting
with Von Pappenheim and his sister upon a little
matter of business which closely concerns myself.
I want you to leave in an hour's time and go to
Hanover. In the Kirchr√∂der Strasse, No. 16, out
at Kleefeld there lives a certain man named Minckwitz&mdash;a
Pole by birth. He has two nieces&mdash;one
about twenty and the other two years older. With
them you have no concern. All I want is that you
engage a photographer, or, better, yourself take a
snapshot of this man Minckwitz, and bring it to me.
Be discreet and trust no one with the secret of your
journey."</p>

<p>"Exactly. There is a doubt as to the man's
identity, eh?"</p>

<p>"Willie" nodded in the affirmative.</p>

<p>Satisfied that I should at last see the mysterious
person whose identity the Emperor had wished to
establish, I set out from Oels on my long journey
right across Germany.</p>

<p>In due course I arrived in Hanover, and found
the house situate in the pleasant suburb. Here I
found that "Willie's" suspicions were correct, and the
man Minckwitz was living under the name of Sembach
and pretending to be a musician. I watched, and
very soon with my own camera took in secret a snapshot
of the mysterious individual as he walked in
the street. With this I left two days later on my
return to Oels.</p>

<p>The photograph was that of a thin, narrow-faced,
deep-eyed man, with a scraggy, pointed beard&mdash;a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
typical Pole, and when I handed it to "Willie" he
held his breath.</p>

<p>"Look!" he cried, turning to Von Pappenheim
and his sister, who were both present. "Look!
There is no mistake! That is the man. What
shall we do? No time must be lost. How can I
act?"</p>

<p>Brother and sister exchanged glances blankly.
From inquiries I had made in Hanover, it seemed
that the man was a stranger, a music-master, who
had arrived there about a month ago. I feared to
make inquiry through the police, because my official
capacity as personal-adjutant to the Crown-Prince
was too well known, and suspicion might have thus
been aroused.</p>

<p>The trio again held secret counsel, but I was not
told the nature of their deliberations. All I knew
was that the Crown-Prince was in some terrible and
most dangerous difficulty.</p>

<p>That afternoon I met the girl Margarete walking
alone in the grounds near the Schloss. The autumn
sun was pleasant, though there was a sharp nip in
the air, which told of the coming of the early Silesian
winter. Most of the trees were already bare, and
the ground was carpeted with the gold-brown leaves
of the great beeches.</p>

<p>We had walked together for some distance, when
I suddenly halted and asked her point-blank why
they were all in such great fear of Herr Minckwitz.</p>

<p>She started, staring at me with her big blue eyes.</p>

<p>"His Highness has not told you, Count. Therefore,
it would ill become me to reveal his secret,"
was her cold rebuke.</p>

<p>"But if the situation is so grave, and if I have
been entrusted with the secret mission to Hanover,
I may, perhaps, be of service in the matter. I understand
that you are acquainted with Herr Minckwitz,
<i>alias</i> Sembach&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"Who told you that?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nobody. I learnt it myself," I answered, with a
smile.</p>

<p>For a second she reflected, then, with a woman's
cleverness, she said:</p>

<p>"I can tell you nothing. Ask the Crown-Prince
himself." And she refused to discuss the matter
further. Indeed, she left the Castle two hours later.</p>

<p>That night I went boldly to "Willie," finding him
alone in a little circular room in one of the towers
of the Castle, to which he often retired to smoke
and snooze.</p>

<p>I stood before him, and without mincing matters
told him what I had overheard and all I knew.</p>

<p>The effect of my words was almost electrical. He
sat up, staring at me almost dazed at my statement.</p>

<p>"It is true, Heltzendorff. Alas! True!" he
replied. But he would even then give me no inkling
of the reason of his fear.</p>

<p>"If this Herr Minckwitz means mischief, then
surely it would be easy to secure his arrest for some
offence or other, and you need not appear in it,"
I suggested.</p>

<p>"I've thought of all that. But if the police lay
hands upon him, then he will revenge himself on me.
He will carry out his threat&mdash;and&mdash;and, Heltzendorff,
I could never hold up my head again."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"I can't be more explicit. I'm in a hole, and I
cannot extricate myself."</p>

<p>I reflected for a moment. Then I said:</p>

<p>"You appear to fear some action of Minckwitz's.
If that is so, I will return to Hanover and watch.
If there is any hostile intent, I will endeavour to
prevent it. Fortunately, he does not know me."</p>

<p>Next night I was back again in Hanover, having
stopped in Berlin to pick up a friend of mine upon
whose discretion I could rely implicitly&mdash;a retired
member of the detective force named Hartwieg.
Together we started to watch the movements of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
mysterious Polish musician, and to our surprise we
found that he had three friends, one of them a
furrier living in the Burgstrasse, who visited him
regularly each evening. They always arrived at the
same hour, and generally left about eleven o'clock.
Through five days we kept watch, alternately closely
shadowing the man who called himself Sembach,
and becoming acquainted with his friends, most of
whom seemed of a very queer set.</p>

<p>There was no doubt that Minckwitz and the two
young women were associates of some criminal gang,
and, further, I was staggered one evening to watch
the arrival at the house of a young man whom I
recognized as Brosch, an under-valet of the Emperor's
at the Neues Palais.</p>

<p>For what reason had he come from Potsdam?</p>

<p>He remained there till noon on the following day.
When he emerged, accompanied by Minckwitz, the
pair went into the city, and we followed, when,
curiously enough, I came face to face with Von
Pappenheim's sister, who was apparently there for
the same purpose as myself! Happily she was too
intent in her conversation with Minckwitz, whom
she met as though accidentally, to notice my
presence.</p>

<p>Then, at last, the musician raised his hat and left
her, rejoining the young man Brosch.</p>

<p>The pair went to a bookshop in the Herschelstrasse,
and presently, when they came forth again,
Brosch was carrying a good-sized volume wrapped
in brown paper.</p>

<p>My curiosity was aroused, therefore I went into
the shop, made a purchase, and learned from the
shopman that the younger of the pair had purchased
a well-known German reference-book, Professor
Nebendahl's "Dictionary of Classical Quotations."</p>

<p>Strange that such a book should be purchased by
an under-valet!</p>

<p>Leaving the detective Hartwieg to watch, I took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
the next train back to Potsdam, where I was fortunate
enough to find the Emperor giving audience
to the Imperial Chancellor. At the conclusion of the
audience I sought, and was accorded, a private interview,
at which I recalled His Majesty's anxiety to
ascertain something regarding the man Minckwitz.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;and have you found him?" asked the
Emperor very eagerly.</p>

<p>I replied in the affirmative. Then he told me
something which held me breathless, for, unlocking
a drawer, he showed me an anonymous letter of
warning he had received, a letter which, posted in
Paris, stated that an attempt was to be made upon
his life, and hinting that the Crown-Prince might be
aware of it.</p>

<p>"Of course," he laughed, "I do not regard it
seriously, but I thought we ought to know the whereabouts
of this man Minckwitz, who is probably an
anarchist."</p>

<p>"Will Your Majesty leave the matter entirely in
my hands?" I suggested. "The police must not
be informed."</p>

<p>"It shall be as you wish. I give you authority
to act just as you deem best if you really anticipate
danger."</p>

<p>"I do anticipate it," I replied, and a few moments
later bowed myself out of the Imperial presence.</p>

<p>During that day I idled about the Palace, gossiping
with the officials and <i>dames du palais</i>, awaiting the
return of the young man Brosch. That night he did
not come back, but he arrived at the Palace about
seven o'clock on the following morning. The head
valet was furious at his absence, but the young man
made a very plausible excuse that his sister out at
Lichtenberg was very dangerously ill.</p>

<p>I had had no sleep that night, but as soon as I
was informed of the under-valet's return, I repaired
to the Emperor's study and secreted myself beneath
a great damask-covered settee which runs along the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
wall opposite the door. For nearly an hour I remained
there, when the door was opened stealthily
and there entered the young man whom I had seen
in Hanover on the previous day. He carried a book
in his hand. This he swiftly exchanged for another
similar book of the same appearance, and a moment
later crept out again, closing the door noiselessly.</p>

<p>Quickly I came forth and took up the classical
dictionary, a copy of which was usually upon the
Emperor's table. It presented just the same appearance
as the book that Brosch had taken away, only
it was considerably heavier.</p>

<p>Without delay I dashed out, sought the Emperor's
valet, and was admitted to His Majesty's presence.</p>

<p>Three minutes later we were both in the study.
I took up the book and held it to his ear. Just as
I had heard, he could detect the faint ticking of a
watch within.</p>

<p>The book had been hollowed out and a time bomb
inserted! It was, no doubt, set to explode between
eight and nine o'clock, when the Emperor would
be at his desk.</p>

<p>"Take it out quickly!" shrieked the Kaiser in
terror, when he realized the true import of the plot.</p>

<p>In obedience, handling the book very carefully,
I rushed with it downstairs out into the open. I
placed it on the grass some distance away, while
the Emperor followed me, utterly astounded at the
discovery.</p>

<p>Having deposited it, I dashed back to where the
Emperor was standing upon the steps, greatly to
the surprise of the sentries, when hardly had I
reached him than there showed a blood-red flash,
followed by a terrific report and concussion&mdash;an
explosion which, had it occurred in the upstairs
study, must have blown the Emperor's head off as
he sat.</p>

<p>His Majesty stood white and rigid, instantly
realizing what a narrow escape he had had, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
the noise caused the greatest alarm, and people began
rushing hither and thither to ascertain the cause.</p>

<p>In a few seconds His Majesty was calm again.</p>

<p>"Say nothing of this, Heltzendorff," he said.
"Let it remain a mystery. Come upstairs and I
will speak on the telephone to the police."</p>

<p>"Your Majesty gave the matter unreservedly into
my hands," I reminded him.</p>

<p>"Ah! that is so. I forgot," he exclaimed, and
after thanking me he added: "Take what steps you
like, but have the offenders punished, and also try
to discover who sent me that anonymous warning."</p>

<p>The young valet, who had been, no doubt, heavily
bribed by Minckwitz to substitute the book, had
already disappeared, and, as a matter of fact, has
never been seen in Germany since.</p>

<p>The man Minckwitz had also, it seemed, suddenly
left Hanover on the night of my departure, for Hartwieg,
following him, reported to me by wire that he
was in Paris.</p>

<p>Without delay I travelled to the French capital,
saw my old friend Pinaud of the S√ªret√©, and told
him the whole story, explaining in confidence that
for some mysterious reason the Crown-Prince feared
that if the man were arrested he might reveal something
unpleasant.</p>

<p>"I quite understand," replied the French detective,
with a smile. "I know that, six months ago, while
the Crown-Prince was in Paris, he was one night
enticed by a girl into the gaming-house kept by the
notorious Minckwitz. There a quarrel ensued, and
the Crown-Prince, fearing attack, drew his revolver,
which went off and shot one of Minckwitz's confederates
stone dead. The Crown-Prince has ever
since been paying big sums to hush up the affair.
Until recently Minckwitz conceived the idea that if
the Emperor died and the Crown-Prince came to
the Throne it would mean to him considerably more
money each year. Therefore he conceived that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
diabolical plot. I warned the Crown-Prince of it,
and he threatened to expose Minckwitz and have
him arrested. Minckwitz, in turn, threatened that
if His Highness made the slightest movement to
thwart his plans he would expose to the world that
the German Crown-Prince, during his latest escapade
in the Montmartre, had killed a man. Finding this
to be the case, I myself wrote that anonymous letter
of warning, which I addressed to the Emperor."</p>

<p>"And which has had the effect of saving His
Majesty's life," I remarked.</p>

<p>That night Minckwitz found himself arrested upon
a charge of blackmailing a Portugese nobleman,
and was later on sentenced to fifteen years' imprisonment.</p>

<p>In his solitary hours in prison he often wonders,
I expect, why his dastardly plot failed. Had it been
successful, however, it certainly would have had a
great effect upon the future history of the world.</p>
